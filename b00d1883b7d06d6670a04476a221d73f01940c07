That\u0027s essentially a global that\u0027s available everywhere, so dumpCommandStreamDiagnostics() has access to it already.\n\ndumpCommandStreamDiagnostics() should probably just not take any parameters for now, and then we can add them in the future if we find that there really are different streams/strings/files/etc. we\u0027d like to pass in.",
