      "message": "No, I believe querying ANGLE would return correct values for all these levels.\n\nThe issue is that since the texture is not mip-complete, it doesn\u0027t make sense to create an image with 3 levels solely based on the size of the first mip (the other mips have bogus sizes), which is what\u0027s happening. Note that the texture is mip-incomplete, which I believe means you cannot sample from it. However, the image is created because there\u0027s a framebuffer attached to level 0 of it. In this case, the image should haven really been created with a single mip.",
