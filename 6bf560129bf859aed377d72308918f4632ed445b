      "message": "No, I believe querying ANGLE would return correct values for all these levels.\n\nThe issue is that since the texture is not mip-complete, it doesn\u0027t make sense to create an image with 3 levels solely based on the size of the first mip (the other mips have bogus sizes), which is what\u0027s happening. Note that the texture is mip-incomplete, which I believe means you cannot sample from it. However, the image is created because there\u0027s a framebuffer attached to level 0 of it. In this case, the image should haven really been created with a single mip.",

      "message": "Ok, and a couple things work together towards the incompleteness:\n- Mipmap completion only applies if the minification filtering parameters use mipmaps. If it does not, then the texture is always mipmap complete.\n- The initial value of GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER is GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR.\n\nAs for sampling from the texture, it seems that\u0027s conditional:\n- However, if you pair this object with a sampler who\u0027s min filter is GL_LINEAR or GL_NEAREST, then that texture image unit will be mipmap complete.\n- Similarly, if a texture uses an integer Image Format, and the paired sampler only uses nearest filtering, the texture will be image format complete.",
