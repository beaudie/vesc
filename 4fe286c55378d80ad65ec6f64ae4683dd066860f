      "message": "nit: Probably worth a comment (for future remembrance) that this may return vk::SpecConstUsage::YFlip and/or vk::SpecConstUsage::Rotation.\n\nSince compileOptions will generally have SH_ADD_PRE_ROTATION set, does that automatically mean that both vk::SpecConstUsage::YFlip and vk::SpecConstUsage::Rotation will always be returned?  Vertex shaders will always get Rotation, but I think that YFlip will only happen for shaders that need it.",
