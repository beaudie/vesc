It\u0027s always easiest to pick another test (TEST_P, inside another test suite/file), copy it and start modifying it.\n\nSince you are generally producing intricate changes, a good rule of thumb is that if you thought about a corner case when developing the change, add an end2end test for it. More often than not, dEQP doesn\u0027t test these corner cases.",
