      "message": "This was added in this CL: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/2358772. Jamie may know why it is no longer used any more. My understanding is that some other changes since then made it unnecessary. (There was quite some changes since then on depth stencil layout and feedback loop area).\n\nI don\u0027t think it has anything to do with what you are thinking of TBR perf thing. For TBR, we are still sending down individual barrier calls. See vk_helpers.cpp around line 1386 CommandBufferHelperCommon::executeBarriers(), there is a for loop and calling glPipelineBarrier for each stage.",
