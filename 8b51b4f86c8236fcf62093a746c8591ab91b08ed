      "message": "Thanks again for catching this bug Mohan. FWIW, the rest of the state changes mentioned in the bug should work fine, I realized that after writing the depth-test change in this CL.\n\nThe reason is that `FramebufferVk::syncState` may do color mask and blend state changes without calling `ContextVk::onFramebufferChange` (if the framebuffer isn\u0027t otherwise changed), which was the bug, but when it _is_ changed, all that other state change in that function is followed by a call to `ContextVk::onDrawFramebufferRenderPassDescChange` which invalidates the pipeline already.",
