      "message": "The feature was introduced in 942d91520aa849728fa5c4d2cc3042687128859e requireing the VK_EXT_swapchain_colorspace extension.\nThe requirement was increased to also require VK_KHR_image_format_list in 15d5965d77c5a4c23fedb22dd35837312d39e563, which was later removed again in 96dd515aa4244332c8426bac586b286a114f8357.\n\nIn this patch I am proposing to remove the dependency on VK_EXT_swapchain_colorspace to allow the case of using a sRGB color space, which was defined in VK_KHR_surface. In addition the color spaces from VK_EXT_swapchain_colorspace need to be enumerated using VK_KHR_get_surface_capabilities2, which is done in the next patch in this series.",
