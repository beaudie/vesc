      "message": "This must be enforced at some higher level in ANGLE, and its behavior defined in ANGLE\u0027s implementation. Sorry I didn\u0027t make this clear earlier. ANGLE is intended to be the centralized place in Chromium for this validation code. Asserts are disabled in debug builds and it would not be acceptable for this code to be entered in production if the driver behaves strangely.\n\nPlease figure out where in ANGLE\u0027s ReadPixels implementation it would be appropriate to enforce the invariant that if the PACK_ROW_LENGTH is less than the width passed to ReadPixels, that it\u0027s temporarily set to 0, and reset to the user\u0027s previously set value at the end of the ReadPixels call. Perhaps this should all be done in ANGLE\u0027s GL backend, since this workaround is specific to that backend; not sure, so please give it some thought.",

      "message": "I\u0027m seeing packState.rowLength \u003c clippedArea.width (which seems to be possibly smaller than area.width) https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:third_party/angle/src/libANGLE/renderer/gl/FramebufferGL.cpp;l\u003d508?q\u003dframebuffergl\u0026ss\u003dchromium\u0026originalUrl\u003dhttps:%2F%2Fcs.chromium.org%2F\n\nI think you are still allowed to pass in packState.rowLength \u003c area.width. Given that GL_PACK_ROW_LENGTH corresponds to GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH. My original interpretation was when packState.rowLength \u003c area.width, the driver will read back the first n\u003dpackState.rowLength pixels from each row.\n\nThat wasn\u0027t necessarily true. The experiment result shows that the opengl driver would return n\u003darea.width pixels for first row and packState.rowLength for subsequent rows.\n\nI don\u0027t find this behavior declared in spec (yet).\n\nThis affects how we gonna rearrange the pixels in the workaround. It also doesn\u0027t seem to have a practical meaning to do this (contrast to setting packState.rowLength \u003e area.width to readback a subrectangle into a subregion of the client image buffer)\n\nGiven this what I\u0027m doing now just set packState.rowLength to 0 when it\u0027s smaller than area.width. A quick glance at the ReadPixels tests in angle shows there aren\u0027t many test cases against these pack row length settings. Current latest patch did this in opengl impl and seems fine with bots result. I\u0027m gonna bump this up to the global validation layer for every backend.",

      "message": "My apologies, the behavior is well defined by the GLES spec. Shrek and I just discussed this offline at length. ReadPixels reads back _width_ pixel groups each scanline, and then increments the destination pointer by _GL_PACK_ROW_LENGTH_ pixel groups. This effectively reads back a rectangle that\u0027s _GL_PACK_ROW_LENGTH_ x _height_, with the last row being _width_ long. The behavior I was proposing above was wrong.\n\nLet\u0027s test the driver-defined behavior in the tests and make sure the workaround works as expected.",
