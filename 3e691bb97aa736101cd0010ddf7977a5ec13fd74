      "message": "I would turn this into a function that walks the graph and calculates the render pass count. The point is that if the Overlay is disabled, you wouldn\u0027t be paying the cost of gathering statistical data.\n\nAdmittedly, I haven\u0027t verified if for example `CalculateSecondaryCommandBufferPoolWaste` above is truly optimized away, since the result is unused. But I imagine adding a `pure` attribute to these functions should do that.\n\nAnyway, this is quite simple, so no big deal. But adding a lot of these little things could add up.",
