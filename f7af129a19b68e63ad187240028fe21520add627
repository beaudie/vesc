      "message": "If it\u0027s going to use for loops, how is this any different from std::bitset? My impressions was that the point of reimplementing this was so that the loops are unrolled and constants are used as much as possible. Note that ANGLE is built with -Os, so loop unrolling is not automatic (usually doesn\u0027t happen with -O2 either AFAIK)\n\nAny perf test you could write for this would be highly useful in determining what works best.",
