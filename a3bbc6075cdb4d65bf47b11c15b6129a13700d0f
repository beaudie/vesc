      "message": "(Apologies for not realizing this earlier)\n\nConsider changing ASSERT_XXX to EXPECT_XXX. \n\nWith ASSERT_XXX, the test will abort when the assert fires. Good for conditions (like resource allocation) where the test cannot possibly continue if the condition is false. \n\nWith EXPECT_XXXX, on the other hand, your test will continue to run and output all of the errors. This is ideal for tests which are flaky or fail only in a test environment. You\u0027ll receive more information in the log to help you diagnose the root cause. Just having ASSERT_XXX means only the first failure will be outputted.",
