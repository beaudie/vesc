In Chrome, it\u0027s common for WebGL contexts to be preempted at arbitrary points. If a real pixel local storage extension were in use would this preemption need to be halted in between glBeginPixelLocalStorageANGLE / glEndPixelLocalStorageANGLE calls because otherwise memoryless textures\u0027 contents would be lost?",
