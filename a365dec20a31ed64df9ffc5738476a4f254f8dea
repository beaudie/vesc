Or is this a reference to GLES1 conformance?\n\nEdit: After reading the rest of the CL, it isn\u0027t actually implemented in Vulkan, so it isn\u0027t conformant, even if untested.  Might be worth replicating the comment from expectations here.\n\nEdit 2: I see it is also mentioned in the CL message, but this is the spot we usually look for reasoning.",
