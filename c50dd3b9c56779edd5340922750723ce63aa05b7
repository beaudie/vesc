      "message": "Maybe I\u0027m reading the code wrong here - but an ASSERT in ANGLE is going to evaluate the expression in Release mode, right? GetValidGlobalContext() does a TLS lookup, which would be killing the performance benefit of the extension.\n\nWe did agree that a non-current context caused undefined behavior. My interpretation of this would be that it would go unchecked. \n\nI added in this hasBeenCurrent() check as a seperate behavior, because it was not compute intensive and would prevent an uninitialized context from being passed. If you\u0027re on the fence, I have no issue removing it.",
