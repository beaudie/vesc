Fetches PartitionAlloc in Angle when not built within Chrome.\n2. Fetches lss when needed. This is a dependency of PartitionAlloc.\n3. Set the default `partition_alloc.gni` flag. Every features are disabled\n   by default.\n\nIn step 1, PartitionAlloc is not used yet. It will be in follow-ups.\n```",
