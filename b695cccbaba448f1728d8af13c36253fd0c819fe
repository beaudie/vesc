      "message": "Ah I see. I was only saying this because my original instinct when reading this code was to require an extra TextureTargetToType() wrapped around it.\nA kinda dumb solution is to reinstantiate a new copy \"type\" with a comment explaining.\nBut I have a feeling I was only prompted to think this way because I\u0027m scrolling through the CL and the change before this has TextureTargetToType(target) highlighted in green.

It\u0027s a little rough seeing both of these within a few lines of each other:\n\n    Texture *texture \u003d getTextureByTarget(target);\n\n    Texture *texture \u003d getTextureByType(target);\n\nIt\u0027s certainly not pretty, but thankfully we can lean on the compiler to make sure the right types are being passed around.\n\nPersonally, I would prefer we rename the parameters to solve a problem we have now, rather than live with it to hopefully solve a problem we may have in the future.   I don\u0027t know enough about the gl.xml stuff though to know how big the trade-off is though.",
