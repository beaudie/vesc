      "message": "Ah I see. I was only saying this because my original instinct when reading this code was to require an extra TextureTargetToType() wrapped around it.\nA kinda dumb solution is to reinstantiate a new copy \"type\" with a comment explaining.\nBut I have a feeling I was only prompted to think this way because I\u0027m scrolling through the CL and the change before this has TextureTargetToType(target) highlighted in green. Up to you!",
