      "message": "I looked in this section but didn\u0027t see any mention of linking errors - I saw the table in section 9.2.1 and this seems to indicate that binding qualifiers must match - ie, it would be an error to have one unspecified and one with a location. Currently in your code this is allowed. Can you confirm this and check there\u0027s a test for this, adding one if absent?",
