These tasks are actually part of link for every backend except for Vulkan. It\u0027s only for Vulkan that these are post-link tasks. So the name sub-task was actually appropriate (and post-link is wrong for all the other backends).\n\nI have some tweaks to the comment here, but let\u0027s undo the name change and I\u0027ll get to it.",
