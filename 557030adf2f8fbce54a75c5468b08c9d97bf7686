      "message": "Hey Jamie, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a bug \n\nIn the ESSL 3.0 spec, on page 39, it prohibits using booleans as a vertex attribute input.\n```\nIt is a compile-time error to declare a vertex shader input with, or that contains, any of the following types(see  4.1.10 “Definitions of Terms”):\n•A boolean type\n```\n\nOn page 19 of the ESSL spec it states:\n```\nThe following are the keywords reserved for future use. Using them will result in an error:\n... (ommitted list of irrelevant keywords)\nlong    short    double    half    fixed  \n```\n\nOn page 22 of the ESSL spec it has a table listing the supported basic data types. If we look at it, apart from bool which is prohibited due to the first quote, there are only data types of type int, unsigned int, float, and data types that consist of multiple components of the previously mentioned types. All 3 of these types that are allowed as vertex attributes and their vec/mat derivatives have a bit width of 32, which matches up with the current bit widths in kMismatchedComponentTypeMap. This means that if we\u0027re always going to use 4 channels, the only allowed vkFormats are the ones listed in kMismatchedComponentTypeMap. If we use any other, we\u0027ll end up triggering a vulkan validation layer complaint about mismatched formats\n\nNow, glVertexAttrib(i)Pointer can take in GL_BYTE and GL_SHORT data, but this isn\u0027t an issue either as the way these are interpreted are defined by the GLES spec. It\u0027ll either be converted to a float, unsigned int, or int.\nIn the GLES 3.0 spec on page 25 there\u0027s a table captioned with the following:\n```\nTable 2.4: Vertex array sizes (values per vertex) and data types. The “Integer Han-dling” column indicates how fixed-point data types are handled:  “integer” means that they remain as integer values, and “flag” means that they are either converted to floating-point directly, or converted by normalizing to[0,1](for unsigned types)or[−1,1](for signed types), ...\n```\n\nWithin angle, we do convert GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE into a gl::ComponentType of Float. If we pass in GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE to glVertexAttribIPointer, and we have an ivec in the glsl shader as the vertex attribute, the vkFormat will be set to match the program\u0027s(VK_FORMAT_R32G32B32A32_SINT). \n\nAs for data correctness - if the app specifies a GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE in glVertexAttribIPointer and they specified ivec in the shader, we\u0027re going to read in 4 bytes per component since we set the vkFormat to VK_FORMAT_R32G32B32A32_SINT. This is enough to fill out each component. I believe this to be the behavior expected by glVertexAttribPointer when used with bytes or any specifier smaller than the shader\u0027s (it\u0027s also how it works on the native gles driver - it packs in 4 bytes into a 32 bit format). \n\n\nSpecs referenced:\nhttps://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/es/3.0/GLSL_ES_Specification_3.00.pdf - referenced as ESSL\nhttps://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/es/3.0/es_spec_3.0.pdf - referenced as GLES\n\nThank you!",

      "message": "Ahh, yeah in the basic case it does eval to VK_FORMAT_R8G8..._UINT, sorry about that! There definitely is a discrepancy, but I wonder if the base case might be the case that\u0027s actually bugged\n\nI see this on:\nhttps://vulkan-tutorial.com/Vertex_buffers/Vertex_input_description\n```\nThe color type (SFLOAT, UINT, SINT) and bit width should also match the type of the shader input. \n```\n\nIf the tutorial is correct, then I think we\u0027d want the vkFormat to be 32 bits to match up with the shader\u0027s input of vec4 which has a 32 bit width. The test I\u0027m looking at is this one: \nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:third_party/angle/src/tests/gl_tests/ReadPixelsTest.cpp;l\u003d539;drc\u003dd6b4c74e9ad2eaa769103e33added4faf2079f49?q\u003dReadPixelsTest\n\nThat test goes from GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE to vec4 so the component type mismatch isn\u0027t hit. \n\nI did a regex search through the vulkan spec 1.1.174 and found this:\n```\nFor each attribute, raw data is extracted starting at attribAddress and is converted from the VkVertexInputAttributeDescription’s format to either floating-point, unsigned integer, or signed integer based on the base type of the format; the base type of the format must match the base type of the input variable in the shader. If format is a packed format, attribAddress must be a multiple of the size in bytes of the whole attribute data type as described in Packed Formats. Otherwise, attribAddress must be a multiple of the size in bytes of the component type indicated by format (see Formats).\n```\n\nThat sounds similar to the vulkan tutorial, but not quite the same. This might not be what the vulkan tutorial is referencing though, I just couldn\u0027t find anything else related to this. That section\u0027s also about indexed rendering, but the rules probably apply regardless\n\nI just modified my test to use a value other than 1, I used 257 as it uses 9 bits of relevant info, and some of the bytes that I expect to get sent in are not getting sent if I use an 8 bit width.\n\nIf we want to be able to fill out a vec4 with 4 GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE specified in glVertexAttribPointer, I think it needs to actually use a 32 bit width as well.\nI\u0027m not sure we want to, but other drivers do let you combine 4 unsigned bytes into an int with glVertexAttribPointer",

      "message": "Hi Shahbaz, the GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE with vec4 use case is bugged as it\u0027s dropping data with an 8 bit width\n\nIf we use an 8 bit width we only get the first byte of data. Other gles drivers don\u0027t drop the next 3 bytes. If we use a 32 bit width format (this matches the vec4) we transfer all necessary bytes.\n\nIn my opinion, the \"workaround\" is the actual correct solution rather than a workaround and the original solution may have to be discarded in favor of always using a 32 bit width.\n\nThe reason this didn\u0027t show up in testing is because all previous tests only used the first byte of data.\n\nIf we don\u0027t want to fix this use case, I can just change this to match the original and drop the data here too with an 8 bit width. LMK if this what we want to do. I suppose having incorrect behavior here probably doesn\u0027t matter much as we haven\u0027t seen any apps relying on it so far. \n\nI can also see if I can get a test that demonstrates the issue approved if you want more info \n\nThanks!",

      "message": "Ok, but to be clear, vec4 in the shader doesn\u0027t mean R32G32B32A32 in the API. R8G8B8A8_UNORM for example is also acceptable for vec4. I\u0027m not sure I quite followed how using an 8 bit format (like R8G8B8A8_UNORM) would get only the first byte of data. Also R32G32B32A32 where UNSIGNED_BYTE is provided sounds like it can be dangerous as it could read outside the boundaries of the buffer.",
