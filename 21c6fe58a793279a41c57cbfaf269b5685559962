The actual units of work seems to be a bit more spread out than I think we\u0027d like, causing the various classes to need to look into each other to get everything they need.\n\nSince the external users of these guys seems to be solidifying now, it may be clearer what the responsibilities should be now if we sit down and describe what each are trying to accomplish.",
