      "message": "Olli, the intent is to eventually auto-generate this file solely based on the GL entry point. As such the generator won\u0027t know which Gen functions map to ValidateGenOrDelete, only that it should call ValidateGenQueries(context, n, ids). I know it\u0027s a pain to refactor all these but if you could add those additional validators that then inside call ValidateGenOrDelete as you have it here it would work towards auto-generation which would help us with the command buffer refactor.",
