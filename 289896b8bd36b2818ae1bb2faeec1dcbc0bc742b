      "message": "Does this want to check the host system, or should this check the target system? If I\u0027m building chrome/win on a linux host, should these json files contain the linux-style lib locaiton, or the windows-style one (where the dll is right in the out dir)? I\u0027m guessing this should likely check the target os instead?\n\nAlso, does it matter that this uses a backslash on Windows? Wouldn\u0027t a forward slash work there too?",

I don\u0027t recall off-hand if it\u0027s sensitive to OS type when parsing slashes.\n\nYour first question: yes, destination system. The script is currently assuming the host and dest are the same.
