      "message": "This definitely helps readability, but I see both of these are always passed as array of 3. We can make the code cleaner here if we make these structs. I don\u0027t know what MemOffset represents, but you may want something like this for example:\n\n```\nstruct MemOffsets\n{\n    size_t x, y, z;\n};\nstruct Coordinates\n{\n    size_t x, y, z;\n};\n```\n\nSee for example `Offset` in `angletypes.h` for the similar GL struct.",

      "message": "One thing I wish C++ had is to make these strong types; as is, you can pass a `MemOffset` as `Coordinate` and the compiler won\u0027t complain. If you are worried about them getting confused (like, we had that happen a lot with GL and VK \"texture level\"), we should look into rolling a helper to make them distinguished.",
