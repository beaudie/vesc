I also fixed a few other things (e.g. master-\u003emain, improve consistency, where to put Labels).\n\nRelative to bug \"Components\", I would click on it for the bug I was creating, and it would show a list that wasn\u0027t relevant.  That\u0027s part of why I made it clear what some of the choices are, and that if somebody starts typing \"Internal\", that a relevant list will start to appear.",
