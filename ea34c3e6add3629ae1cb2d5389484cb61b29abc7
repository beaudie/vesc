      "message": "So from what I understand the crashes only happen on proprietary Mali drivers - and even with the `angle-disabled` flag set (see e.g. https://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/chromium/builders/ci/ChromeOS%20FYI%20Release%20(kevin)/9485/test-results?q\u003dExactID%3Aninja%3A%2F%2Fchrome%2Ftest%3Atelemetry_gpu_integration_test%2Fgpu_tests.context_lost_integration_test.ContextLostIntegrationTest.GpuNormalTermination_OriginalWebGLNotBlocked+VHash%3Aa7311f0a6272cea9 ).\n\nGiven the oddness of these crashes, I wouldn\u0027t rule out that a revert will somehow \"fix\" the issues. But I have strong doubts that the CL is at fault here and I\u0027m trying to reach out to people familiar with that hardware/driver.\n\nThat being said, IF the revert fixes the crashes, it should be save to land. While it blocks some Exo work of mine, it shouldn\u0027t break anything else :/",
