      "message": "I don\u0027t see where this gets called for program pipelines. Do we forego this validation for pipelines? It would be nice if we could make a small angle_end2end_test for this if there\u0027s a gap in dEQP coverage and leave it with a tracked issue and TODO. From the spec:\n\nIt is not allowed to have variables of different sampler types pointing to\nthe same texture image unit within a program object. This situation can only\nbe detected at the next rendering command issued which triggers shader invocations, and an INVALID_OPERATION error will then be generated",
