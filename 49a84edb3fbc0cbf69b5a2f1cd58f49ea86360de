In this particular case, I would say that translating UBO to SB itself is the workaround, as it\u0027s working around an issue with FXC.\n\nMy suggestion is to make this \"translateLargeUniformBlocksToStructuredBuffer\" (or something along those lines), then enable it everywhere except AMD/windows. In the future, if we get a choice not to use FXC, it could also be conditioned to FXC.",
