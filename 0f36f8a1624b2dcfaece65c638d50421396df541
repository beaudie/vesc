      "message": "The Reset calls are constructed during MEC, for every default uniform.\nThe dirty location set is populated during the run, whenever a new value is sent down, then consumed during Reset.\nYou could probably change up the indexing so we only index a single map with the programID, but the map would need to contain a struct containing the dirty set and all the reset calls.  I don\u0027t think it would be worth it, but let me know if you feel strongly about it and can do a follow up.",
