      "message": "I think we can make the logic in this change simpler. `createDeviceAndQueue` is called when creating the display, which means the blob cache functions are _never_ set at this point.\n\nSo from here, we should only just call a function that inits the pipeline cache without attempting to load anything from the cache.\n\nThen the usual calls to `ensurePipelineCacheInitialized` from `Renderer::getPipelineCache()` can just work as they did before.",
