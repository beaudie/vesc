      "message": "Using a dynamic year isn\u0027t fully supported as it makes the auto-\ngeneration depend on the date. Also we do not need to update the\nyear in the copyright notices for any files in ANGLE.\n\nIt causes a maintenance burden. We explicitly enforce a style policy to not auto-update copyright dates because it provides exactly 0 benefit to us and causes maintenance churn.",

      "message": "There is a benefit to knowing when a file was updated. We autogenerate the date in headers in a bunch of places AFAICT. Rather than locking on the old date, updating the range would be more valuable, i.e. 2016-2020.\n\nBut if you want to strictly adhere to the coding standard (https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle/+/HEAD/doc/CodingStandard.md#comments), then they shouldn\u0027t be updated.",

      "message": "You can always run \u0027git log\u0027 on a file to see its entire update history.\n\nThis is motivated by adhering to the coding standard we maintain across the repository, and avoiding having to maintain a date in our auto-generation scripts (right now you can get unexpected updates when the year changes on your machine and you didn\u0027t change any of the auto-gen). It\u0027s an important feature that the auto-generation doesn\u0027t depend on anything not specified in the json hash dictionaries, and adding the year to those dictionaries is not worth it IMO given our the code standard linked above.",
