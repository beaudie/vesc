      "message": "This is not sufficient. If a render pass loadOp is used to clear something, this could be empty. You could perhaps add a test that checks `mRenderPassAttachmentOps` doesn\u0027t have any clears.\n\nI would like to know under which condition you\u0027ve seen this though (with `SecondaryCommandBuffer`), and maybe there would be a better optimization (in the very least, we wouldn\u0027t allocate a block for the command buffer and then not store any commands in it).",
