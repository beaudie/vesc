      "message": "Yeah. If you know the root folder of the traces, you can scan the subfolders for *.json to identify what traces are present on the device. Then restricted_traces.json wouldn\u0027t be necessary on the device at all.\n\nThe extra bit of work you\u0027d need is to prune deleted traces when you\u0027re starting the run. Which seems like something that would be good to do anyway, although we don\u0027t delete traces very often.",

      "message": "OK, Roman pointed out that wouldn\u0027t necessarily be the best solution.\n\nConverting the GN argument in the linked CL into a build-time subset of restricted traces would solve all the issues. It\u0027s pretty similar to what Shabi did in his CL, with the added step of getting the override list all the way to the device.\n\nHappy to take a crack at this if it can wait or to advise on how to implement this solution, though I\u0027d prefer if someone else could do it b/c it might take me a while to get to.",
