      "message": "The tradition to reland CL is to upload the original CL as patchset 1, and then apply the delta changes in the reland CL in patchset 2: https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle/+/HEAD/doc/ContributingCode.md#relanding-a-reverted-cl. \n\nSince there is no difference between this reland CL and the original CL, I suggest adding in the CL commit mentioning that there is no additional change between this reland CL and the original CL that got reverted:\n\n```\nReason for revert: Revert to reland once AOSP change is sorted out. No additional change is added in this reland comparing to original CL commit 86d128c0f37f4ed1c598319c418ae13a37bfb909.\n```",
