      "message": "I also have the same question as Shabi asked here. My understanding is that when we startRP, we ensure outsideRP flushed to primary first so that they will always go before RP. It is unclear to me that the commands recorded into outsideRP while RP is open should go before RP or after or doesn\u0027t matter. Can you or Jamie clarify this and maybe put comment somewhere in the code?\n\nAlso if it is truly required that outsideRP commands flushed before RP, then maybe we should do it inside endRenderPass().",
