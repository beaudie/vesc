      "message": "I made some progress towards a regression test [1], but I\u0027m blocked by a number of issues. One is that my laptop doesn\u0027t expose EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import_modifiers, and I\u0027m not sure it would be easy to upgrade mesa and/or the kernel without support from the gLinux team.\n\nAs such, I don\u0027t know if this code has any bugs, but until such time as testing is possible, I think it\u0027s better to have it landed so it won\u0027t conflict with other related work. Also would make it easier to test (when possible) if the tester is not myself.\n\n[1]: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/3163363",
