      "message": "I think the above list is not strictly ordered, either. For example, `deqp_gles3_rotate*` tests came after `deqp_khr*`.\n\nThe order of expectation files here also needs to match with index order in `GetTestModuleIndex()` at line 280. If I insert the new tests in the middle of the list, I will need to change the index numbers in `GetTestModuleIndex()` (pushing index back by 1 or 2), which I think is unnecessary changes.",
