Another example: `GL_UNSIGNED_INT_10F_11F_11F_REV` added there as an unsized float format, although it is always sized.\n\nFor the norm16 case:\n- signed and unsigned RGB are also missing;\n- probably, all signed unsized norm16 entries should have NeverSupported in their caps.",

This was filed separately under crbug.com/1408247 but I hadn\u0027t debugged it yet.\n\nlgtm with Alexey\u0027s comments addressed - all of the formats in https://registry.khronos.org/webgl/extensions/EXT_texture_norm16/ should be included in the format table. From my standpoint the other packed formats should be done in a separate CL.",
