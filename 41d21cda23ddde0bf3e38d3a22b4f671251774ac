Context: https://gitlab.khronos.org/vulkan/vulkan/-/issues/2906\n\nSummary of the bug (that\u0027s not accessible to you) is that `HardwareBufferImageSiblingVkAndroid::initImpl` is not looking at the EGL attributes, particularly `EGL_GL_COLORSPACE_SRGB`. Hacking things to use `GL_SRGB8_ALPHA8` instead of `GL_RGBA8` for the internal format leads to VVL error about trying to create an image with one format (srgb) that doesn\u0027t match the AHB format (unorm)\n\nThe failing test is `android.hardware.nativehardware.cts.AHardwareBufferNativeTests#SingleLayer_ColorTest_GpuSampledImageCanBeSampled_R8G8B8A8_UNORM_sRGB`, I assume it\u0027s in the Android CTS test, but Yiwei can clarify. If you do run this test, what did you do to make it work?",
