      "message": "This CL fixes 14 tests while breaking 11 tests, so it\u0027s a net positive of 3 more tests passing. Also, instead of crashes, the new failures are all pixel differences. A few of them are clearly missing RGB \u003c-\u003e BGR conversion somewhere (see conformance/canvas/webgl-to-2d-canvas.html, for example), but I\u0027m still unsure where this issue is.\nThis also makes the code spec compliant regarding Vulkan, where the IOSurface object is no longer treated as a generic blob of memory (which it isn\u0027t, it has properties like planes, row pitch, etc).\nAll in all, despite a delta of only 3 more tests passing, I think the change is a net positive.\n",
