Can we design this such that the \"external format\" (uint64_t, maybe should be a strongly typed wrapper class) is treated as an entirely different type from a VkFormat? i.e. don\u0027t assume they are interchangeable.",

      "message": "The program and context modules dont need to know the distinction between an immutable sampler tied to an external format vs. a VkFormat. In fact i would go as far as to say they **should** not know there exists such a distinction. All they need to know if is the pipeline or texture needs an immutable sampler and if so some key to uniquely identify such a sampler.\n\n\u003e is treated as an entirely different type from a VkFormat?\n\ncan you provide some info on what value is added by making such a distinction when all the functionality (except descriptor count query) is common to both?",

      "message": "it\u0027s like storing a blend state or a depth state as a uint32_t. what exactly is the external format? It\u0027s an AHB format or something? I think you should keep the two types distinct. There\u0027s a theoretical risk that there could be a value collision if my understanding is correct.",
