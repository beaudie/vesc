Since some tests are failing, and it\u0027s probably because of GL_DrawArraysInstancedBaseInstanceANGLE() is being called in those tests. Previously GL_DrawArraysInstancedBaseInstanceANGLE() is calling context-\u003edrawArraysInstancedBaseInstance(), but now it is calling context-\u003edrawArraysInstancedBaseInstanceANGLE(), and leaving it as UNIMPLEMENTED() would cause errors.",
