      "message": "Here and in several places below: this constructor initializes the random number generator with the current time as the seed:\n\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:third_party/angle/util/random_utils.cpp;l\u003d20?q\u003dRNG\n\nThis will cause non-determinism in the tests, and make it much harder to debug failures. Could you please pass in constants to the constructors of these RNG instances? While this will decrease test coverage, it will also make the runs deterministic.",

      "message": "I second that. Also, now you are losing coverage for the \"edges\" of the image (though that might not really matter in this case).\n\nI suggest using the positions you had before, but instead with a for loop and a pre-defined array like:\n\n    unsigned int positionToTest[10][2] \u003d {{0,0}, {75,0}, {98,13}, ..., {127, 127}};\n\nThat makes it easy to see which pixels will be tested, and easy to add certain pixels if some were found to be problematic.",
