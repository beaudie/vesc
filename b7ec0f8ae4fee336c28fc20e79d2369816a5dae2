      "message": "Is the check here really helpful for non-zero levels? If Size0 is mip0\u0027s size and Size0\u003e\u003elevel \u003d\u003d Size, that doesn\u0027t mean that Size\u003c\u003clevel \u003d\u003d Size0. ValidCompressedBaseLevelForWebGL is testing Size\u003c\u003clevel, but that\u0027s not necessarily the actual mip0 size. Given that it\u0027s a shift left (and block size is probably like 4 or 8), that would pass for any level \u003e\u003d 2 or 3.\n\nThe bug says:\n\n\u003e an implicit requirement was added that the 0th level of mipmapped compressed textures must be block-sized\n\nIsn\u0027t it sufficient to only perform this test for level\u003d\u003d0?",

      "message": "Tests already exist for level\u003d\u003d0. Understanding that Size\u003c\u003clevel doesn\u0027t necessarily equal Size0, there are still some obviously invalid situations. For example, if width or height\u003d\u003d1 at level 1, that implies level 0 has a width or height of 2 (or 3), which is invalid.\n\nThe new tests that were added in https://github.com/KhronosGroup/WebGL/pull/3304 and that I\u0027m following up on in https://github.com/KhronosGroup/WebGL/pull/3307 verify these constraints. They seem reasonable to me to enforce. What do you think?\n\n(The new angle_end2end_tests in this CL are ports of portions of those WebGL conformance tests, and fail pretty badly without these changes.)",
