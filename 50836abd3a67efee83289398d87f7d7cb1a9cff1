      "message": "Checking that garbage collection occurred is a difficult thing to verify, since there isn\u0027t a good way to check for the absence of something.   Digging around a little, it seems any GL queries about the texture would just be state types of things that are updated immediately by the front-end when the texture is deleted.\n\nIf you issue a drawQuad() or glReadPixels() call here, would the front-end catch that there is no texture bound and fail immediately, or would an error be generated by the back-end that signifies the texture was deleted correctly?",
