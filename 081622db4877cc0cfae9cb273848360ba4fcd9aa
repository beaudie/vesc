      "message": "I also modified these methods to address invalidate, and so I want to coordinate with you ...\n\nI changed the methods to always be called when gl*nable(GL_DEPTH_TEST) (or stencil) are called, to try to discern from syncState when an invalidated attachment becomes used again.  In essence, the states are:\n\nA) NeverInvalidated\nB) InvalidatedWithDepthEnabled\nC) InvalidatedWithDepthDisabled\nD) UsedAfterInvalidated\n\nFor PUBG, it typically goes from A to B (but could go directly) to C.  PUBG never goes to D, but the dEQP tests do (always from C to D).  At endRP, I set storeOp to DONT_CARE for C (since an app can theoretically draw again from state B, and we don\u0027t want to do anything in setupDraw()).",
