      "message": "When using the draw path, the values sampled from the RGBA source texture (the Canvas) will be converted to sRGB when stored in the target sRGB texture. What\u0027s needed here is that no conversion occurs at all when storing in the sRGB buffer, but there isn\u0027t an easy way to do that using the draw path.\n\nOne way would be to modify the copy fragment shader that ANGLE uses so that when copying to an sRGB texture, have it perform an sRGB -\u003e Linear conversion of the sampled texels so that when they get converted to sRGB on write to the target texture, they end up with the original value. This would means adding another flag to the current set of flags (isInt, isFloat, isArray), and I\u0027m not sure this is really what you\u0027d want.\n\nThis bug is something I spent time looking at with geofflang@, and once we realized this bug was something that occured for all Vulkan drivers, he suggested that we handle this in the same was as is done for the GL backend.",

      "message": "Well, if a feature goes through a CPU readback path, it\u0027s worse than not existing in my opinion, as it severely hurts an applications framerate. At least if the feature doesn\u0027t exist, the application has a chance to do something else, which we are taking away by providing an inefficient implementation.\n\nThe shader compilation flags are used for things we can\u0027t really choose dynamically, such as sampler types etc. For something like this, you can simply add a flag to the push constants sent to the shader, and add a simple `if` in the body to do the sRGB-\u003eLinear conversion. Let me know on Chat if you need help figuring out how to do that.",
