As written, this API seems somewhat perilous - this is meant to be an array of pointers (in fact, that\u0027s how it declared in glDrawElements). Why is ANGLE\u0027s version narrowed like this? It\u0027s impossible to safely pass a pointer to this function on a 64-platform.\n\nMSVC caught this with a warning at the reinterpret_cast: conversion from \u0027long\u0027 to \u0027void*\u0027 of greater size.",

I recommend you update the spec and implementation to mirror that. It could lead to a real problem as Brian suggests.",
