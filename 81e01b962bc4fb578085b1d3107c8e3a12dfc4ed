      "message": "Will we now always be creating either a full mip chain, or a single level? Were there situations in which we were purposefully creating different numbers of mip levels than would exist for the texture dimensions? I don\u0027t think the non-4x4 DXT case would have been one of those situations, since we\u0027re sizing it up above in MakeValidSize, but am not sure if there are others.",
