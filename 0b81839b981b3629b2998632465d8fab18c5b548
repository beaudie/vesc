      "message": "The more I read about this stuff, the less I think this CL is necessary and would actually cause additional problems by checking in all of the undesired `third_party/` content.\n\nWe already remove the `.git` directories for the `third_party/` libraries that ANGLE requires in AOSP (ref1).   We are doing this so those libraries are checked in as part of ANGLE, rather than as git submodules, when the `git add` command is performed later.   With the `.git` files present in the remaining `third_party/` libraries still present, git will ignore those directories which prevents them from being checked in.\n\nThe AOSP CL that removed the git submodules (aosp/1927617) deleted the full directories, which included removing the `.git` files.   Since `roll_aosp.sh` is not removing the unused directories, they were re-added as part of the next ANGLE roll.   However, since the `.git` files were present when the Skia bot executed the `git add` command, the contents of the directories were ignored, so the libraries were not actually re-introduced.\n\nReading the documentation for Git Submodules (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules), the only way for them to be reintroduced is by explicitly running the `git submodule` command.   We don\u0027t currently use submodules anyway, so it should be easy to continue avoiding them.\n\nThoughts?",
