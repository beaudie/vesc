      "message": "Replacing the noop by bool temp \u003d false; sounds fine but couldn\u0027t we remove the cases instead until we don\u0027t finish with a noop? Right now this looks like a driver bug workaround that should live in Compiler. Making it simplify the code looks more like dead code elimination that is driver independent.",
