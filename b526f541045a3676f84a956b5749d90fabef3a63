      "message": "There should be no such situation according to using blockName[0] to check otherwise we can\u0027t use \u0027[0]\u0027 to stand for other elements in array.\nAnother evidence is that if we have a block array like below:\nlayout(packed) uniform blockName {\n  float f;\n} instanceName[3];\nvoid main() {\n  v \u003d instanceName[2].f;\n}\n\nthe active block number is 3. But the active uniform number is 1 which\u0027s name is blockName.f. It seems that the three active blocks share the same uniform. So, the three blocks are all active since blockName.f is used.",
