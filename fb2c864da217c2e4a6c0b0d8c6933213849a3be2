      "message": "Missed that. For sure it is an interesting point, it looks easy but isn\u0027t totally trivial. I thought for a couple minutes and couldn\u0027t produce such a duplicate. I inserted the sizes of the shaders and intermingled the resources string - this should at least make it quite difficult (if not impossible). I like the colons for readability, LMK if you think it\u0027s insecure with the salted size and resources string.",
