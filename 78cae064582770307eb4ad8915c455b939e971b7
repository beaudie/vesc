      "message": "It is.  I wanted this change to be incremental.  My intention is to eliminate viewportYScale and the padding once I support pre-rotation for:\n\n  - gl_PointCoord\n  - dFdy() \u0026 dFdx()\n\nI started to do it as part of this CL, but thought there might be throw-away work when I get to those topics (i.e. do one/both need flipX as well as flipY, which affects whether or not I do swizzling).  I promise to address this in the follow-on CL for those topics.",

I need vec2 (.xy) versions of these for rotating, but I may still need float (.y) versions of each.  I\u0027ve been looking at adding code to get a .y from a vec2, and it seems like adding unnecessary code that will cause the shaders to run slower.\n\nI\u0027m planning to keep both for now.",
