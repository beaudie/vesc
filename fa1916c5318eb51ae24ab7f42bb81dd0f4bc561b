If the new render pass has unresolve, the subpass index still has to be reset because the unresolve commands should be recorded to subpass 0.\n\nI understand there\u0027s a bug, I\u0027m afraid this is hiding a bigger problem. Do you think you can figure out why the `resetSubpass` call in `ContextVk::onRenderPassFinished` is not taking care of this? Is that function just not called? Is it called but `mRenderPassCommandBuffer` is nullptr? What happens if you move the `resetSubpass` call out of the `if` in that function?",
