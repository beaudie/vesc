      "message": "Couple of questions:\n1. Seems like angle_native_trace_tests also runs non-trace perftests, so I think we should remove angle_perftests suite where they run?\n2. Why is this so slow on Android? But, at the same time, why is it so much faster than angle_perftests? Does dividing into 20 shards makes the suite to run 4 times slower than 4 shards?",

      "message": "1. it does not ATM\n2. the relative speed difference is just because this new test config runs way fewer tests\n\nhowever I\u0027m not sure this provides the necessary test coverage we need because the prior regression only happened after a full iteration with the Reset() call. it probably doesn\u0027t hurt (and may help slightly) to land these tests, but we\u0027ll have to think harder about how to test Reset() functionality.",

      "message": "Running these traces just to catch general errors on native would be good to have.\n\nOne thing I\u0027ve noticed when creating new traces is the first frame after Reset() will have artifacts, usually shadow related, but they are cleared up quickly in the next few frames.  Comparing the first frame overall with the frame after Reset() would be a good test.  Or maybe serialize state right after Setup(), then again right after Reset().\n\nWe know we have gaps in Reset(), so it probably won\u0027t be clean right away, but it can help guide development of Reset(), much like retracing has helped improve MEC.",

If it doesn\u0027t, why do I see for example BindingsBenchmark.Run/gles_null_100_objects_allocated_at_initialization both in https://chromium-swarm.appspot.com/task?id\u003d57dcb4f651edf510 and in https://chromium-swarm.appspot.com/task?id\u003d57dcb50666c4e210?\n2. Looks like angle_native_trace_tests runs 4*118\u003d472 tests and angle_perftests runs 20*24\u003d480 tests, so doesn\u0027t look like a significant difference to me. But in the meanwhile, I\u0027ve figured an answer to this question by myself in the context of crbug.com/1279512. Copying 6GB test APK to the phone takes ~10 minutes. So with 20 shards we waste ~10*20 minutes out of the total 236 minutes just for the copy. And with 4 shards we only waste 40 out of 78 minutes. In both cases it takes 36-38 minutes for the actual test run. Looks like 4 shards is a much more efficient way.",
