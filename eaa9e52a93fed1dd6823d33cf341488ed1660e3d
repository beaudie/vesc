We are not using the direct-to-backbuffer rendering (mNeedsOffscreenTexture is false)\n\nI think doing these checks in SwapChain11 would be sufficient instead of passing this parameter around.",

      "message": "I was confused that despite the comment https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/446907#message-2299acd97bb6c38fb0eb975e4b9fcb9e234fa613 and the one just below for Passthrough2D11.hlsl it passed that review without distinction if MSAA is needed for the swapchain or not. So I thought maybe it should remain like that for EGL_D3D_TEXTURE_ANGLE (which actually really makes no sense if EGL_D3D_TEXTURE_ANGLE if for PBuffers only) and this is why I wanted to propagate the info if buftype !\u003d EGL_D3D_TEXTURE_ANGLE down to the swap chain. But if that is not needed, then it\u0027s fine to just check for the native window handle and mNeedsOffscreenTexture, right!",
