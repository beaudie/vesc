      "message": "I\u0027d like to try throwing a lot of resources at these tests to see how low I can get the variance, then trimming it back and seeing if we can keep the high quality. I already made some changes to the test running harness to speed these up 4x. Running test in batches introduces potential for a lot of variance.\n\nAnother avenue to pursue is to use a test harness that\u0027s more designed for our use case. We can keep an open socket and communicate with the device as we go instead of continually re-polling with ADB.\n\nAlso keep in mind this is only run in CI, so it\u0027s only a few runs a day, less than 1x per ANGLE commit landed.",
