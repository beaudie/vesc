I believe we had a discussion about removing the inefficient emulation path but i think the consensus was bots will take about a year to have \"VK_KHR_image_format_list\" enabled and so we keep the emulation path around for a bit.\n\n\u003e Why isn\u0027t the test added in [1] failing with this change?\n\nneed confirmation but their platform may have default support for \"VK_KHR_image_format_list\" so removing that requirement ends up being a noop for them?",
