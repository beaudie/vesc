      "message": "It seems that the `mRenderPassCommandBuffer \u003d\u003d nullptr` inside this function meant to really say hasStartedRenderPassWithCommands() (like used below to determine `isMidRenderPassClear`).\n\nBut I was wondering though, does this mean glClear for mid-RP clears will appear correctly in AGI, but not out-of-RP clears? Shouldn\u0027t glClear always appear as glClear no matter what? I don\u0027t really follow the logic of `mSkippedLoggingAClear`. Seems to me that if RP is not open, the event should simply record on the outside-RP commands, maybe?",
