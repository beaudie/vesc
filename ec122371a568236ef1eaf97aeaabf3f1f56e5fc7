      "message": "It seems that the `mRenderPassCommandBuffer \u003d\u003d nullptr` inside this function meant to really say hasStartedRenderPassWithCommands() (like used below to determine `isMidRenderPassClear`).\n\nBut I was wondering though, does this mean glClear for mid-RP clears will appear correctly in AGI, but not out-of-RP clears? Shouldn\u0027t glClear always appear as glClear no matter what? I don\u0027t really follow the logic of `mSkippedLoggingAClear`. Seems to me that if RP is not open, the event should simply record on the outside-RP commands, maybe?",

      "message": "So far, all of the \"graphics pipeline\" AGI markers have equated to inside-RP command buffers.  I think this is worth a try.\n\nIn our 1-on-1, I\u0027ll talk with you about the dilemma/discussion that\u0027s been had about showing all glClear\u0027s at the high-level in AGI.  The mid-render-pass approach was an attempt to bridge that gap, but I\u0027m evolving back to showing them all (different people have had diverged opinions about what to show).",
