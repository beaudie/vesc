      "message": "Now that I think of this more, this grammar rule only needs to return the basic type and its column/row count. TPublicType has all sorts of extra data that\u0027s not needed. It would be cleaner to return just a simple struct with TBasicType, rows and columns from here, and have TPublicType::setBasic to take in that struct and the qualifier. That way the EvqUnspecified wouldn\u0027t be needed either.",
