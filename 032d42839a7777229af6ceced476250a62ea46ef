The PLS tests were my best attempt at breaking image load/stores, and none of them reproed, and I just spent some time trying to make a tests that breaks it using atomics without success.\n\nLuckily, the PLS tests that use SPV_EXT_fragment_shader_interlock *do* break without this change, so once that lands, we will have a repro on the bots that verifies the memory qualifiers work (or at least the \"coherent\" one).",
