      "message": "This is not quite the same test as I mentioned in the other comment. The blend one in particular is about making sure the load op of the render pass is LOAD instead of DONT_CARE. The load op is a function of whether the contents of the color attachment are valid or not.\n\nSo it\u0027s the `dstTexture` itself that should be rendered too, not used as a sampler. The content validity tracking has no effect on sampler usage of the texture.\n\nWould you please move this to a separate test where the blend-into-mip-1 is done right after `glGenerateMipmap` with nothing in between it? And the blend should be _into_ mip 1, not _sampling from_ mip 1.",
