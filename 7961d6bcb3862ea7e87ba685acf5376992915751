      "message": "This reads a bit funny that you are setting an incompatible level after guarding it with just the allocation check.  I see that you are passing in the redefinition bool, so it ends up correct.  I just had to read it a few times to make sure.  I thought maybe a different variable name might clear it up, like mRedefinedLevels (where true is incompatible), but I think that might make the rest of the code confusing.  Probably fine to leave it as is.",
