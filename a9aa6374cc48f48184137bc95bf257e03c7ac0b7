Intel mesa has VK_EXT_shader_stencil_export, but I\u0027m not sure if the bots are recent enough. FYI, since your device has VK_EXT_shader_stencil_export, it\u0027s not going to be taking this hackish path.",

      "message": "It is still not quite clear to me why this would help with keeping multisampled stencil data on tile.\n\nFor instance, if we have a 1*1 stencil buffer, and its\u0027 stencil value is 80 (1010000). After drawing 8 quads with below loop, isn\u0027t the resulting stencil value the same? Also why the latter draws won\u0027t overwrite the results in previous draws?",
