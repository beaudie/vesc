Because the only tool at our disposal is `discard;` here, i.e. it\u0027s a binary decision. Without VK_EXT_shader_stencil_export, the shader cannot \"copy the entire value\". So for example the shader could either accept the currently configured mask N or reject it. If you want to copy entire values, you\u0027d have to loop 256 times.\n\nThe binary decision is used to output exactly one bit (i.e. a binary piece of data!).",
