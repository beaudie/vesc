      "message": "The assertion is that if baseLevel was greater than zero before, there will be a staged update for it, and you won\u0027t reach this code.  That\u0027s key to this working for texStorage in particular.  I added the assert below because we were seeing very large level counts since srcLevelVK is unsigned.  It should help catch any new scenarios we haven\u0027t thought of yet.",
