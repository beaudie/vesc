      "message": "Asphalt 9 uses GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE attributes as uvec4 in the vertex shader for indexing arrays in an uniform buffer.\nWhile this works on native GLES QC, it fails when replaying the trace on ANGLE. This also fails with Mesa native OpenGL on Intel and AMD.\nThis test is able to reproduce the issue, where VertexAttributeUByteTest.Vec4 passes everywhere and VertexAttributeUByteTest.Uvec4 only passes when running with native GLES on QC.",

It seems to fail during shader compilation. I can skip the test there.\nThe relevant failing test using uvec4 is skipped everywhere besides QC OpenGL. It will fail when ANGLE_SKIP_TEST_IF line is removed.",
