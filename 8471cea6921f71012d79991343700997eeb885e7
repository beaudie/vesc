      "message": "Please advise if I should implement this some other way. Right now the implementation of glDebugMessageControl only appends to the internal list, so it\u0027s not possible to override the behavior of the built-in control objects. Perhaps it should search the list by source, type, and severity, and manage the list of IDs and their enabled state differently.",
