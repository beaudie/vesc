      "message": "From a caller\u0027s point of view, this feels like an unintended side-effect of just getting a pointer.   For example, in TextureVk::copySubImageImpl() when this is called, copySubImageImplWithTransfer() will call addReadDependency() which does the onGraphAccess() work.\n\nIf the onGraphAccess() calls were missing, I think those should be added as explicit calls where they are missing, rather than duplicating the onGraphAccess() work in here.",
