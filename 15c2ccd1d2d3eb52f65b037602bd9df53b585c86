The two runs failed on different steps:\n\nhttps://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/chromium/builders/try/mac-angle-rel/13388\nhttps://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/chromium/builders/try/mac-angle-rel/13395\n\nThey both failed on Intel GPUs and both took over 40 mins. Building locally I can\u0027t pass either build_angle_gles1_conform_tests or internal_gles2_conform_tests as build flags, so I can\u0027t verify myself. Running other tests on an *unpatched* HEAD on a Mac Mini with Intel GPU and 10.15 (which I\u0027m guessing is the same setup) I see quite a few errors, e.g.:\n\n\u0027angle_deqp_egl_tests\u0027\ndEQP-EGL.functional.fence_sync.invalid.create_invalid_display\nNo results file specified.\n\nSignal 6:\nBacktrace:\n    angle::Handler(int) (+0x2c)\n    _sigtramp (+0x1d)\n\n\u0027angle_deqp_gles3_tests\u0027\n[----------] Global test environment tear-down\n[\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d] 44198 tests from 1 test suite ran.
