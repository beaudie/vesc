There will most likely be downstream commits that don\u0027t make it upstream, so the histories will differ.  I\u0027m okay with this, but curious if it is a concern for others.",

I guess this is a question for Geoff and Tim who maintain the downstream versions.  Are you planning to upstream all changes that occur?  Are there any downstream files not maintained upstream?  And if so, do we care if those changes are not reflected in the ANGLE version?\n\nActually, the histories may already differ, so the versions will never match.  I\u0027m okay with them differing, but I haven\u0027t built ANGLE in the Android tree very much.",

      "message": "You\u0027ve presented a solution that is based on git history, so it most likely cannot be replicated downstream.  That means downstream will either need to inherit the version and use it as is (which is probably fine), or come up with their own solution which will make their version incompatible.  Since the downstream builds will have different package names anyway, it won\u0027t matter if their versionCode can\u0027t be compared.\n\nI\u0027d wait for Tim to chime in.  I would recommend the downstream builds try to use the same version.h that comes in, and not try to regenerate it based on history.",
