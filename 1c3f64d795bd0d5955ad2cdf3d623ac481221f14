      "message": "We shouldn\u0027t make this a global static with an exit-time destructor. You will need to initialize and free it somehow within a non-global scope. You could jump into InitializeDebugAnnotations even though it\u0027s not the right named function.\n\nLong-term it would be better if ERR() and WARN() didn\u0027t use global variables. Instead they could use a context that works even if multi-threaded. But this is quite difficult so I\u0027m okay with using an easy solution like this.",
