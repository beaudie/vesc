      "message": "If we were to support other back-ends you\u0027d be right. I\u0027d like to define a policy that the back-end is a) always going to be SwiftShader for now and b) the back-end is defined to the left in the tags section, not in the right in the test name. Eventually in the far future we can remove the back-end from the test name.\n\nSee angle_end2end_tests_expectations.txt for how this can look WRT to the back-end. Anyway not a big deal, just a small consistency cleanup that doesn\u0027t need to block progress.",
