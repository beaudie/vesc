Is that a problem?\n\nThere should be a test like this, but if not can you write one?\n\n- Generate mipmap (note that nvidia/amd doesn\u0027t use this path, you can set allowGenerateMipmapWithCompute to false for debugging)\n- Use the texture as sampled image with mipmap right away\n\nThis should generate:\n\n- Blit\n- Barrier TRANSFER-\u003eBOTTOM_OF_PIPE\n- Barrier TRANSFER-\u003eSHADER_READ_ONLY\n- Draw\n\nPlease enable syncval locally if VVL doesn\u0027t complain about a test like that.",
