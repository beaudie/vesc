Description:
base::MRUCache is a few collections of most-recently-used caching structures.
To update the checkout, simply overwrite the folder with Chromium's latest, and apply
the appropriate namespace.

Modifications:

- base/logging.h defines CHECK to be ASSERT to be compatible with ANGLE.
- base/numerics/*.h uses namespace angle::base instead of base:: to avoid ODR
  violations when ANGLE code is mixed with Chromium code.
