# Shader Variations

To build multiple variations of a shader, add a file named X.json corresponding to shader file X.

There are multiple possible fields in the json file:

- "Description": This contains the license and other comments, which will be ignored.
- "Flags": this is a list of flags.  Each flag FLAG defines a shader variation with or without the
  define FLAG=1.
- other: any other field is a similar list to flags, except that each entry in this enumeration is a
  variation.  Similar to "flags", every variation VARIATION results in a VARIATION=1 define.
