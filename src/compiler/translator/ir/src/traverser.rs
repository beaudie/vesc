// Traverser utilities for the IR.  Fundamentally, there are two types of traversers:
//
// - A visitor does a read-only traversal of the IR.
// - A transformer may mutate the IR at the instruction or block granularity.  The
//   instruction::make! and instruction::make_with_result! macros can be used to generate new
//   instructions during transformations.  To avoid excessive modifications to the IR, when
//   transforming an instruction that produces a given id, use instruction::make_with_result! on the
//   final instruction to produce the same id, leaving the rest of the IR intact.
