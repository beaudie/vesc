This function currently is for checking Vulkan properties. If you want to check GLES 3.2 support via extensions, we can redo our Context.cpp checking to instead determine GLES 3.2 from available extensions. That\u0027s totally fine if you\u0027d prefer to move that there. Especially for GLES 3.2, which is determined entirely by extensions. As a benefit of placing the check in the front end, other eligible back-ends would be able to re-use the GLES 3.2 support checking code.",
