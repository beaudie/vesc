      "message": "Looks pretty similar to the last one, though I\u0027m even less familiar with the rules and subtleties of D/S stuff.\n\nThe only thing that stands out is that it seems all of the testing always has a color and D/S attachment when there\u0027s any drawing being done.   Is it possible to draw with just a D/S attachment and then attach a color attachment to verify the D/S contents (or query the D/S attachment directly)?",

      "message": "mini-rant: It would be nice to have these gl::IMPLEMENTATION_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS [+ 1] depth/stencil index values explicitly defined somewhere, so we can avoid this assumption about where depth/stencil live (and these magic +1s).   Unfortunately, there are a lot of places where the D/S index is determined by looping through all of the color attachments and then +1 to the final count, which some kind of well defined enum value wouldn\u0027t help with.\n\nIn a more perfect world, functions like these set() could even take a typed value, which is defined to contain the color, depth, and stencil attachment indexes, rather than raw uint32_t colorIndexGL that\u0027s used everywhere.\n\nOf course, with more time eventually this will all look more natural and maybe this is all just a non-issue for everyone else.",
