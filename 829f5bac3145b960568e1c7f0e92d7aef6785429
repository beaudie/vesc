The reason the spec says there\u0027s no special behavior if ES2, is because ES2 doesn\u0027t have those functions to begin with.\n\nThe extension spec is the way it is because it\u0027s a _diff_, and it\u0027s a diff against _multiple specs_. So it talks about how GLES3.1 is modified, then strips part of it away (or changes the diff) for older versions just because like GLES2 is obviously a different spec so the diff doesn\u0027t apply!",
