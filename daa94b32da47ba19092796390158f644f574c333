      "message": "Discussing this live with Shabi, it seems best to me to always enable SPIR-V debug info for WebGL-compatibility contexts in ANGLE. It adds significant debugging support and would fix the win-angle-chromium-x64-try failure, which is happening because the well-known, built-in variable name \"gl_FragCoord\" isn\u0027t showing up in the SPIR-V disassembly.",
