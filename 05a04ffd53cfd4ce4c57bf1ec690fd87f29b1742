      "message": "The loop serves to get all buffer bindings to initial state.  It explicitly skips bindings with no buffer bound (0).  It tries to be clever about whether to re-bind GL_ARRAY_BUFFER.  I\u0027m not sure the complexity is worth the one line of code it saves, redundently binding the array buffer.\n\nThis is basically saying *\"Our array buffer does not match the one bound in replay state\"* and we use that to change it.  And then below, *\"We changed the array buffer, we need Reset calls!\"*.\n\nThe `New` confused me for a minute.  How about `isArrayBufferChanging`?",
