      "message": "Is this the best way? The ProgramExecutable belongs to a Program or a ProgramPipeline, changing the bindings in glState doesn\u0027t affect that (but this code suggests it does). I\u0027m guessing changing glState makes things work in such a way that only the ProgramExecutable of the Program or ProgramPipeline that\u0027s bound will be accessed, but this feels very fragile.\n\nIs this a temporary measure and will be fixed in a future CL? I\u0027d be ok with that. It seems to me that something is backwards here though, like the information queried here should reside in ProgramExecutable, with Program accessing it through mExecutable when necessary, instead of the other way around.",
