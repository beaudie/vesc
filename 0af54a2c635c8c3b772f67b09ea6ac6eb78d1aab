      "message": "Repeating from Chat for posterity. This is not releasing the image after initializing it. This is releasing the image after ensuring that the vk::ImageHelper is at least allocated.\n\nI think the reason for this is repeated glTexStorage2D calls. You should be able to write a test for this:\n\n- glTexStorage2D on texture T\n- Use T, like draw blue into it\n- glTexStorage2D on texture T again, but with wildly different parameters\n- Use T again, making sure a new image is created for it.\n\nNot sure what\u0027s the best way to check the last step. It should be easy to cause validation errors, but something that properly fails... I can imagine binding it as an image and getting the imageSize() in a compute shader would work, but maybe there\u0027s something simpler.",

      "message": "I guess another way to verify could be:\n\n- First glTexStorage2D, create the texture as 128x128\n  * (don\u0027t forget to draw with it so it\u0027s created)\n- Second glTexStorage2D, create the texture as 64x64\n- Attach to framebuffer and clear to red\n- Blit from another image that\u0027s green into area (0, 0, 64, 64)\n- Bind as sampler and render the whole image into the swapchain\n- Make sure it\u0027s all green\n\nIf the 128x128 image is still used after the second glTexStorage2D call, then the clear would clear it entirely to red, but the blit would make only a quarter of it green.",
