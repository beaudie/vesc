      "message": "Good questions and gripe!  In hindsight, I think we should have allowed getting capabilities per present-mode (we\u0027re looking at adding that).\n\nBefore I get into background, let me ask: what is your goal for adding one image?  Is it to allow ANGLE to have one image being displayed, one queued for presentation, and one to render to (i.e. avoid latency and increase frame rate)?\n\nI\u0027ll provide some explanation from spec-land, and what I know about different implementations (hopefully won\u0027t bore you to death:-) ...\n\nOriginally (I\u0027ve seen some changes lately), Android (and probably all other drivers/platforms) allowed a swapchain to be created with only 2 images (minImageCount \u003d 2).  Android (and I think other drivers/platforms that support MAILBOX) added 1 image for MAILBOX in order for it to really work as intended.  One image is being shown to the user (call it A).  One can be queued to be shown (B).  One can be rendered to (C).  If the app is running fast, it will call vkQueuePresent (QP) with C before B is ever shown to the user.  In that case, C becomes queued to be shown and B becomes the next image returned by vkAcquireNextImage (ANI).  If the app isn\u0027t running that fast (no reason for them to use MAILBOX), B will be shown to the user before QP is called with C, and A will be the next image returned by ANI.\n\nWithout 3 images, MAILBOX wouldn\u0027t work for a blocking implementation.  In my example above, if A is being shown to the user, once QP is called for B, ANI would block until B is shown and A becomes available.  The app would never be able to run faster than the display\u0027s refresh rate (which MAILBOX is designed to allow).\n\nAlternatively (for non-throttling implementations), A would be returned immediately by ANI.  A could be rendered to and QP called with it, and B would be returned by ANI, etc.  For example, a really fast app, with FIFO, could queue 1000 versions of B and 999 versions of A, all while the originally-rendered version of A is still being shown to the user.  For MAILBOX, the same app would queue that many versions of each, but the queue would be drained back down to 1 each time QP is called and the rendering is completed for the new image.  The last I knew, MoltenVk (Apple) worked that way, but I think they may have \"fixed that.\"\n\nBTW, we would consider that to be really bad for Android (waste of power), and the power governors might lower CPU power for that app until it\u0027s frame rate becomes more reasonable.\n\nBTW, shortly after Vulkan 1.0 came out, NVIDIA on Windows started doing a minImageCount of 1.  They can use an MS-Windows capability that allows them to quickly blit the image to a window-system-private buffer, allowing ANI to immediately return the same image again (and potentially not provide any throttling BTW).\n\nI\u0027m sorry that it\u0027s such a complicated situation!",

Perhaps Jamie can clarify his reasoning, but my guess is that on whichever platform this was tested, minImageCount was 2 and we wanted triple buffering (for the same reason you mentioned). I do agree that it could have been done better (for example default to 3, then clamp to min/max).\n\n\u003e Android added 1 image for MAILBOX in order for it to really work as intended.\n\nWouldn\u0027t it have made more sense for android to take min(3, requested) instead of requested+1 images? As in, if the developer asks for 3 images (even if min is 2), then android wouldn\u0027t add a fourth image?\n\n\u003e I\u0027m sorry that it\u0027s such a complicated situation!\n\nNo this is all very interesting.

For all implementations that I know of, I would suspect that \u0027imageCount\u0027 will be the same each time UNLESS it starts running out of memory.  The scenario is if somebody takes the mouse and starts interactively resizing the window, and the app tries to keep up.  Many new swapchains can be created in a short time.  However, from our Khronos discussions, I think the drivers are responding by being more synchronous (e.g. throttling the app and flushing things so that old swapchains get freed quickly).  Not sure about this.\n\nI wonder if the Khronos Vulkan SI TSG should discuss this in the context of ANGLE sometime?",
