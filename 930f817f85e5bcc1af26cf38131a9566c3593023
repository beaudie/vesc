      "message": "For GOLD failures, I (or someone) would have to approve the new image. Normally that\u0027s trivial, but actually Manhattan looks suspiciously different. The background after your change seems a bit shifted and less blurry. Isn\u0027t that odd? Are you able to see the GOLD failures? Does this link work? https://angle-gold.skia.org/detail?test\u003dmanhattan_10\u0026digest\u003d327a82e7276bf6190001c94c0d26798b\u0026changelist_id\u003d3453288\u0026crs\u003dgerrit\n\nLooks like the shader with or without subgroups is not producing identical results, and I don\u0027t really know which one is correct! I\u0027ll make a point of looking at this on Monday and see if I can figure out what\u0027s changing here.\n\nDid you have a GOLD failure in the earlier patchsets? I\u0027m wondering if the check for mSubgroupExtendedTypesFeatures.shaderSubgroupExtendedTypes is making Nvidia/Linux not use compute anymore (because it\u0027s on an old driver). If you didn\u0027t see GOLD failures before, removing that check will probably make the failure go away.",
