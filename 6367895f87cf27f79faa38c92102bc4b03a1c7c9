To repeat what I said in your doc, I think we should try to contain the workaround to the D3D code, by a) keeping a copy of the dirty bits in RendererD3D b) storing them on calls to RendererD3D::syncState, and c) StateManagerD3D::syncState with our internal copy of the dirty bits here, and clearing them. Also we may have to move the syncState to genericDrawArrays/genericDrawElements right before the skipDraw, if those other calls to applyThisAndThat call force bits.",
