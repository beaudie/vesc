That would add a very large amount of overhead to the tests if we end up needing to use it, though. I also wouldn\u0027t want to add that until the automatic cleanup of old/unused images is live. Last I heard from Kaylee, the plan was to roll that to all instances eventually but they were still trialing it on Skia\u0027s instance.",
