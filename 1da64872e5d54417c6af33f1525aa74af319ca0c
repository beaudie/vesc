      "message": "I\u0027m not entirely sure this is correct.\n\nThere\u0027s also the D/S feedback loop code that unconditionally uses the DepthStencilReadOnly layout for the texture. I _think_ that\u0027s fine because the layout will be correctly set to DepthStencilReadOnly or DepthStencilReadOnlyWithStore at the end of RP through the attachment. Not 100% sure either.\n\nThere\u0027s a failure with D/S feedback loop, so obviously something\u0027s not right. WDYT of any of this Charlie?\n\nAn alternative to this solution I can think of is a hacky ImageHelper::mExtraSrcAccessMask that would accumulate VK_ACCESS_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT despite the layout being DepthStencilReadOnly, and when transitioning out of the layout, add mExtraSrcAccessMask to the srcAccessMask.",
