Presumably we\u0027d need to a global list of all Threads we\u0027ve seen issue EGL commands so we can iterate through them and update their pointers when a Context is destroyed.   We may be able to restrict this tracking to just eglMakeCurrent() and iterate in eglTerminate().\n\nWhat I don\u0027t know about this approach is how safe it is in terms of multithreading.   How parallel can the execution of these calls be?\n\n\u003e Is the assertion actual harmful or just warning that we may safely ignore? \nIt\u0027s helpful and can\u0027t be ignored since we\u0027d attempt to free resources that don\u0027t exist otherwise.\n\n\u003e Also from the description this sounds like app bug?\n\nThis is not an app bug.   Threads can eglDestroyContext() a context that\u0027s current on another thread and eglTerminate() and display used by multiple threads.\n\nFrom the EGL 1.5 spec describing eglTerminate():\n\n\u003e If contexts or surfaces, created with respect to dpy are current (see section 3.7.3) to any thread, then they are not actually destroyed while they remain\ncurrent.",

I\u0027ll try and poke at a fix while we wait for input from Geoff/Jamie (since they are on vacation).\n\nGeoff/Jamie - Thoughts?",
