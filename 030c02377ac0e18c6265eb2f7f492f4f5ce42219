      "message": "ANGLE has a few D3D-specific limitations that slip into client contexts, like simultaneous use of constant color and constant alpha blend funcs or base mip level of compressed textures having to be a multiple of 4.\n\nIn this particular case, the difference between GL and D3D semantics is quite subtle. GL imposes only the total cap on clip and cull distances, effectively allowing `0 + 8`, `1 + 7`, `2 + 6`, `3 + 5`, and `4 + 4` combinations, while D3D implicitly restricts this to `0 + 8` and `4 + 4`, because it defines these vertex outputs as `float4` vectors and only two are allowed.\n\nGiven that the proposed limitation does not violate the explicit GL requirement of 8 clip, 8 cull, and 8 total distances and shader compilation is allowed to fail for any reason, I think it\u0027s reasonable to keep it as is.",
