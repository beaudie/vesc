      "message": "I took a look at this change with RenderDoc. The change to ContextVk is definitely good (see the other comment). However, the test was correct, and there\u0027s a bug still somewhere. With preferSubmitAtFBOBoundary, I expected to see an extra submission between the end of render pass and before the image-\u003ebuffer copy for glReadPixels. That submission is not there, so preferSubmitAtFBOBoundary is not working as expected.",

I looked at the test in RenderDoc with `preferSubmitAtFBOBoundary`, and right now (before this change) there\u0027s a submission right after the first iteration! We should make sure to catch that in the future.",
