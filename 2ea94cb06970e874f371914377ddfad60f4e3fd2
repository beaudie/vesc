      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is correct on all non-Windows platforms and compilers. Chromium\u0027s src/build/common.gypi seems to need a bunch of different flags for different toolchains. See for example the setting of CLANG_CXX_LANGUAGE_STANDARD, as well as the setting of \"-std\u003dgnu++11\" elsewhere in the file. What motivates this change and what is the side-effect on the Chromium build?",
