Maybe you should omit wsiLayer from the device extensions? In this case maybe you could leave the device code untouched.",

We\u0027ll only see that if we get device extensions from VK_LAYER_FUCHSIA_imagepipe_swapchain.\n\nThe spec says that device layers are deprecated and that the list of device layers must be the same as the list of instance layers going forward (but applications should still pretend that device layers are separate from instance layers for compatibility).",
