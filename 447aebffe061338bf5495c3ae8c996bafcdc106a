      "message": "It would also be helpful to vary this on every iteration a bit, like `params.updateSize * (17 + it%7) / 20` (varying by 5% every time), so we don\u0027t easily fall into some situation where the worlds align and one thing is a multiple of another and things work out.\n\nI see that Tim suggested making the buffer and update size a power of 2, but that probably makes things even more star-aligny. It would be good to have a test variation for that too, so we have coverage for both POT and NPOT update sizes.",

      "message": "If you\u0027re still taking requests, it would be nice if these were more parameteric (and you can focus on variations on Vulkan). For example, one parameter to vary updateOffset, and another for updateSize (to make it very small, like 128 bytes, in light of the vkCmdUpdateBuffer discussion).",
