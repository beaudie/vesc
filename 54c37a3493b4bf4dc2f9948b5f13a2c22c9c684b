      "message": "According to the experiment results, the maximum stride should be 2048:\nOn Win10 machines this value can reach 4095, but the value does not work on the Windows trybots or my Win8 Broadwell notebook using HD Graphics 5500.\n\nI agree with Yuly that we should support as large relative offset as possible. As this value is emulated on D3D and there is no explicit limit on offset both in D3D and OpenGL, I suggest we choose std::numeric_limits\u003cGLint\u003e::max() in D3D11.",

      "message": "The test you refer to is NegativeApiCase. It checks that using offset bigger than GL_MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIB_RELATIVE_OFFSET fails. The test returns early for GL_MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIB_RELATIVE_OFFSET \u003d\u003d 0x7FFFFFFF because it is not possible to test offset bigger than that.\nThus, I do not agree.\n\nBTW, I don\u0027t see dEQP testing that using offset \u003d\u003d GL_MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIB_RELATIVE_OFFSET actually works.\nHere\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/deqp/+/master/modules/gles31/functional/es31fVertexAttributeBindingTests.cpp#378\nthey only test 32 or 19.\n\nI don\u0027t mind (can\u0027t speak on others\u0027 behalf though) if you leave offset \u003d\u003d GL_MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIB_RELATIVE_OFFSET untested, I was just pointing out that since your previous version of the test will always test offset \u003d\u003d 2047, might as well have it hard-coded, and not hidden inside ?: operator.\n\nCurrent version is equivalent to skipping this test on Nexus 5X, which seems unnecessary, you can just test with some smaller than 0x7FFFFFFF offset.",
