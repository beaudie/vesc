      "message": "Is this fixing any tests?\n\nLooking at the header:\n\n```\ntypedef struct _cl_command_queue *  cl_command_queue;\ntypedef struct _cl_mem *            cl_mem;\n...\ntypedef struct _cl_sampler *        cl_sampler;\n```\n\nit looks like `sizeof(cl_mem)`, `sizeof(cl_sampler)` and `sizeof(cl_command_queue)` are all equal.  So it looks like the original code was _correct_ (if not obvious). If that\u0027s true, you could have also made things better here with a simple `static_assert` that ensures the sizes are the same.\n\nEither way, I\u0027m not opposing this change, just thinking out loud.",
