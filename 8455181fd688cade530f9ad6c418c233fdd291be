      "message": "It\u0027s fine to no-op these for now but it might let us implement a ring buffer in GL in the future.\n\nSay the user creates a buffer with the DYNAMIC hint. If the user then maps the buffer for write, we must assume that the user can overwrite some bits but not others. If the user maps with INVALIDATE_RANGE then we can discard the whole region and allocate a new chunk from the dynamic buffer.\n\nThis is a performance optimization though so it\u0027s not high priority to fix immediately.\n\nCommented in issue 3213.",
