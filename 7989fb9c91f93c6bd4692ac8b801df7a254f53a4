      "message": "Hi Shabi (cc some others),\n\nI created this prototype CL to help me develop and debug the Vulkan extension we want to create for calling WSI \"surface\" queries before we have a VkSurfaceKHR.\n\nFor now, I suggest the extension name: VK_ANDROID_surfaceless_query.  Perhaps it should be a KHR or EXT, and perhaps there\u0027s reason to change the name, but it\u0027s a start.\n\nThis CL combined with two Android platform CLs (ag/16168795 and ag/16168796) allow me to get EGLConfig\u0027s with the following formats on two test different devices:\n\n- GL_RGBA8 (always had this one)\n- GL_RGB_565 (always had this one, but ANGLE should be querying it)\n- GL_RGB8 (used to have this one, and I optionally added it to Android)\n- GL_RGB10_A2 (want this, and Yiwei optionally added it to Android)\n- GL_RGBA16F (want this, and Yiwei optionally added it to Android)\n\nThere\u0027s definitely clean-up that\u0027s needed (input welcome).  We can\u0027t land this CL until the extension is defined and in place.  Thus, I -2\u0027d my own CL:-).",

      "message": "As an aside, it\u0027s a little worrying that RGB565 was assumed by default previously. I don\u0027t love that this CL isn\u0027t laser focused on the extension alone, but removing a previous cruft like this is truly welcomed.\n\nWhat happens in the case that a device doesn\u0027t support surfacelessQueryExtensionEnabled? Shouldn\u0027t 565 be included then?",
