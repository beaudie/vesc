      "message": "@bsheedy@chromium.org: the crashes mentioned in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/3946903 strongly suggest that we\u0027re dealing with a driver bug - on a proprietary driver not updated since 2018.\n\nI tried to work around that now - can I ask you to test the patch here with the previously crashing test, in order to avoid further reverts? That would be super helpful to me! :)\n\nUnfortunately the crash logs do not reveal all that much about the exact crash reason, so I can only guess what\u0027s needed here.",

      "message": "Sorry, the build was slow and ended up getting distracted. Due to our perpetual kevin capacity shortage, the build didn\u0027t end up finishing, but it did run a number of our tests before timing out https://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/chromium/builders/try/gpu-fyi-try-chromeos-kevin/378/overview\n\nThere are a few failures, but they look unrelated to this CL, and suites that were failing before (e.g. gpu_process_launch_tests) are passing now, so I think you\u0027re clear to reland.\n\nIf this does end up causing problems when it lands, I suspect they\u0027ll be fairly minor and can be addressed in follow-ups rather than requiring a revert.",

Looking around the code, I don\u0027t see a clean solution that wouldn\u0027t require too much surgery. So far, the workarounds are one set per backend, but a new workarounds set for EGL is probably easy to do. We already deal with the front-end and back-end features getting mixed.\n\nUnless @geofflang@chromium.org or @jonahr@google.com have any ideas, I\u0027ll let this through to unblock you, and you could experiment with adding an instance of features for EGL as a follow up.",
