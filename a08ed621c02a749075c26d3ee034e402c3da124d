      "message": "@bsheedy@chromium.org: the crashes mentioned in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/3946903 strongly suggest that we\u0027re dealing with a driver bug - on a proprietary driver not updated since 2018.\n\nI tried to work around that now - can I ask you to test the patch here with the previously crashing test, in order to avoid further reverts? That would be super helpful to me! :)\n\nUnfortunately the crash logs do not reveal all that much about the exact crash reason, so I can only guess what\u0027s needed here.",

      "message": "@syoussefi@chromium.org: unfortunately the existing caps/feature framework from `gl_features.json` etc. can not be used here as at least the GL part is only initialized later. So in case this workaround is needed, do you think it would be ok to have stuff like this in the code - or would you like to see a new caps framework for EGL?",
