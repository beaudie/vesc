      "message": "Since RPs behave so differently with events, how about we don\u0027t try to unify this? Like, have `flushSetEvents` be specific to the outsideRP commands class (which can also call `collectRefCountedEventsGarbage` itself), and have the `executeSetEvents` be internal to RP commands (also calling `collectRefCountedEventsGarbage` itself) and called automatically on `executeCommands` like it is now.",
