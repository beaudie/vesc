      "message": "I agree the ParseContext is badly designed (probably because of multiple rounds of expansion). If it is a struct, the members should be public, but named differentlt (mXXX indicates it\u0027s private).\n\nI would suggest to keep the members here to be consistent, but fix the naming. We should redesign this to be a class (a struct with so many member functions with complicated logic is a clear violation of coding style). At that time, we should move members to private and add accessor functions.",
