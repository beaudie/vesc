However, in initial test w/ AGI it is not showing the begin/end debug calls like RenderDoc does.\nIf someone is setup to run RenderDoc on Android and wants to give this a try there let me know what you see.\nI may try it as well but don\u0027t currently have RenderDoc set up so doing some other testing for now.",
