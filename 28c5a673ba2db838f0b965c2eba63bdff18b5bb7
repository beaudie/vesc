      "message": "Ok I have a theory as to what\u0027s going on. Since you are calling vkQueuePresent as a workaround, VVL is considering the image given back to the swapchain, hence expecting an ANI.\n\nYou should be able to fix this by adding:\n\n    if (mSwapchainPresentMode \u003d\u003d VK_PRESENT_MODE_SHARED_DEMAND_REFRESH_KHR)\n    {\n        ANGLE_VK_TRY(context, acquireNextSwapchainImageImpl(context));\n    }\n\nAt the end of present()?\n\nOr just go back to PS10, that seems more appropriate now that we know ANI needs to be called every frame.",
