Imagination (only one with EXT_pls2) agreed to update the driver to conform with the EXT_pls change going forward, but older drivers would still require this for ANGLE_pls to be secure.\n\nDefinitely no need to use EXT_pls2 functionality to make PLS+Attachment work, just the clear is enough. Hopefully that would make the blind code a bit less risky :-S",
