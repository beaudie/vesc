      "message": "Ack. Recall the gentlemen\u0027s agreement that led to https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-Registry/pull/540 was that EXT_pls2 is used to clear the attachments if available. Imagination (only one with EXT_pls2) agreed to update the driver to conform with the EXT_pls change going forward, but older drivers would still require this for ANGLE_pls to be secure.\n\nDefinitely no need to use EXT_pls2 functionality to make PLS+Attachment work, just the clear is enough. Hopefully that would make the blind code a bit less risky :-S",
