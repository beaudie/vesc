      "message": "Thought about this a bit more: I suggest you add `\u0026\u0026 isSwiftShader` for now to reduce the risk for shipping platforms (like B* and chromeOS). Since this has not been tested on any real GPUs and this will be shipped out to user now. Then some months later some driver implements supportsDynamicRenderingLocalRead and all of sudden user see this preferDynamicRendering enabled. There is risk here that they may run into bugs or performance regressions that they do not have an easy way to workaround. Explicitly limit to swiftshader for now and enable it until we have tested at least on one real GPU will avoid most of the risks.",

      "message": "FWIW, Joerg tried this with the r50 ARM driver, and it seems to have worked just fine, including Camera. For desktop drivers, we\u0027ll hear soon enough if Chrome Dev hits issues on Linux. For Android emulators, this is likely not a problem because the Vulkan tunnel still has to implement the extension, and ANGLE won\u0027t use it until they do (at which point they\u0027d test things). ChromeOS also rolls ANGLE infrequently and with lots of testing.\n\nTBH, the risk is minimal (especially given that it works fine on ARM).",
