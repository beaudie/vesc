      "message": "I guess I should first call getSamplerIndex(textureUnit) to get the index, and then pass to getUniformIndexFromSamplerIndex().\n\nBut in getSamplerIndex -\u003e getUniformIndexFromLocation, the location passed in is the sampler location, but seems what it wants is the uniform location, I think they are different.\nSo, any idea about how to get the uniform index from a sampler location? Thanks.",

      "message": "Yes, I have been thinking about it, and I think having AllGraphics as the only option is indeed better (despite what I\u0027ve been advocating previously). Imagine the following:\n\n- Draw: Texture 1 used in FS only\n- Draw: Texture 1 used in VS and FS\n- Draw: Texture 1 used in FS only\n\nThis would incur two barriers, and there\u0027s little we can do to improve the situation there (at least not until we store the layout transitions especially in the graph nodes so we can modify them).",
