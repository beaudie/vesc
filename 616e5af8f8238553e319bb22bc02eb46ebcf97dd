      "message": "CL says:\n\n\u003e The maximum value of pattern_size is the size of the largest integer or floating-point vector data type supported by the OpenCL device.\n\nVulkan has `vkCmdFillBuffer` that implements this functionality using 32-bit values. You should be able to use that more efficient and less-GPU-bubbly command for at least some cases (`patternSize` equal to 1, 2 and 4). For the rest, eventually you\u0027d want to use an ANGLE-internal compute shader to do the buffer fill (A CL version of UtilsVk).",
