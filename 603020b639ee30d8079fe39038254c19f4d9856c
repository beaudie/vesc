      "message": "FYI, this is what I did in my hack (use the driver for these), but what we do in Chrome for the stub GL is in ui/gl/gl_stub_api.cc (overrides for non-trivial cases which are autogenerated like yours in ui/gl/gl_stub_autogen_gl.cc). Notably, hardcoding the static glGetIntegerv values to be the required minimum for ES3.\n\nIt might be useful to do something similar for 2 reasons:\n1- more accurate comparisons (e.g. if driver exposes many texture units, there may be perf differences due to scaling)\n2- null GL backend (as opposed to null backend) may be a good target for the fuzzers (exercises more of the code, provides more opportunity to the fuzzer to find \"interesting\" patterns).\n\nNot a blocker of course, just something to think about.",
