      "message": "I guess it depends. without suballocation, this likely end up with one page memory. If app does uses device local memory it will use the block memory. I am okay with keep this empty buffer not using suballocation (I was a bit hestated in the first place anyway). But this CL does exposed a few other bugs that I try to fix in this CL. How about I revert this empty buffer to non-suballocation and take the rest of change?",
