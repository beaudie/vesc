      "message": "Can this lock taken after cache lookup? This really only need it before you starts async linking job, right? You can\u0027t recompile while it is still here.\n\nWhat I am thinking the cleaner way maybe move this `ScopedShaderLinkLocks shaderLocks` into `ProgramLinkedResources` structure and then pass around this ProgramLinkedResources object instead of the shaderLocks. That way it gives you better encapsulation for the linker and flexibility to add more stuff into it in the future. (ProgramLinkedResources might change to ProgramLinkerResources as well).",

      "message": "Unfortunately it can\u0027t. The cache key for example depends on shader info. The `dumpProgramInfo` right below too.\n\nRegarding where it lives, I\u0027m not sure that helps actually. What you\u0027d want is for RAII to take care of unlocking the locks after the job _ends_, rather than _destructed_. That\u0027s why the backend\u0027s `operator()` calls all `std::move` this to a local variable. If you pass it as part of `ProgramLinkedResources`, and assuming `ProgramLinkedResources` is moved to the job, RAII still only unlocks the shaders after the link job is destroyed. And if we have to `std::move` it out of `ProgramLinkedResources`, then it doesn\u0027t feel like there\u0027s much encapsulation going on.",

      "message": "Right now yes. Today, we have:\n\n- glCompileShader(VS): reset shader info on main thread, start a compile job\n- glCompileShader(FS): ... same ...\n- glLinkProgram:\n  * Wait for shaders to finish\n  * Do a lot of the link on the main thread\n  * Do backend-specific link in a job\n\nThe wait in glLinkProgram is obviously terrible, and the second part (link in the main thread) also only works because of the share group lock.\n\nHowever, I want to change things to look like this:\n\n- glCompileShader(VS): start a job that does _everything_\n- glCompileShader(FS): ... same ...\n- glLinkProgram: start a job that:\n  * Waits for the shader jobs\n  * Does everything about the link\n\nSo eventually everything happens between the compile and link jobs, without involvement from the main thread. In that case, the share group lock does not exist to protect anything.\n\nAlso part of the plan is to make the job creation be done entirely in the frontend (because now all the link can be done in the job). That means that the `ScopedShaderLinkLocks` don\u0027t even get passed around, they\u0027d just end up being local this function!",
