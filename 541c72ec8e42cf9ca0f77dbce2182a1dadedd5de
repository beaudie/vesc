      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is correct for drawElements - you\u0027re passing in the range of indices, not vertices. We\u0027ll need to compute the index range to get the real vertex range. I think for now you can leave this \"broken\" with a TODO and fix this as follow-up work. Also wouldn\u0027t hurt to make a test for it - something like using a draw with a 12 vertex buffer with 6 indices [6,7,8,9,10,11] - this code will theoretically copy [0-5].\n\nAlso I think our convention is usually to pass first vertex/count instead of last vertex - it has the minor advantage of not ever having to validate last \u003e\u003d first.",
