      "message": "I don\u0027t like calling ensureImageInitializedImpl() directly (skipping ensureImageInitialized()), but this allows the tests to all pass while dereferencing mFormat directly in ImageHelper::stageSubresourceUpdate().\n\nI need to skip ensureImageInitialized() so I can pass along the correct size/format values, since the values pulled from contextVk in ensureImageInitialized() are wrong.   I haven\u0027t tried setting those values in contextVk before calling ensureImageInitialized() since I have no idea how safe/correct that is.\n\nThoughts on a clean way to do this since it seems to be on the right path to what we want (assuming passing tests implies correctness)?",
