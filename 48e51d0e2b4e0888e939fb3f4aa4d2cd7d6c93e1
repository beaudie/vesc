      "message": "This is fantastic - great work tracking this down.\n\nIs there a code path where if glInvalidateFramebuffer is called after glBlitFramebuffer, ending the render pass - that MTLStoreActionStoreAndMultisampleResolve for this attachment can still be downgraded to MTLStoreActionMultisampleResolve? That will retain the performance advantages of the previous code when it\u0027s legal to. Theoretically, in Chrome, using  preserveDrawingBuffer:false in WebGL\u0027s context creation attributes will allow this downgrading.",
