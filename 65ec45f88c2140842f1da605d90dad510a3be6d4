      "message": "Hi Olli, in this patch only formats that support multisampling can affect maxIntegerSamples, maxDepthTextureSamples and maxColorTextureSamples.\n- For required formats, they should always support multisampling, so we won\u0027t miss any of them here.\n- For formats that are not required, we only consider those that support multisampling, because the formats that don\u0027t support multisampling have no valid sample counts.\ne.g.\nGL_BGRA_EXT is skipped because it isn\u0027t a required format and doesn\u0027t support multisampling on Intel.\n\nHow do you think about this solution?",
