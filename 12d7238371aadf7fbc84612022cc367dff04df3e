      "message": "Constantine, it looks like the `win-trace` failure is real.  I was able to repro with the following:\n\n```\nvpython3 src/tests/capture_replay_tests.py --gtest_filter\u003dMultisampleTest.AlphaToSampleCoverage/ES2_Vulkan_SwiftShader\n```\n\nand got the following output:\n\n```\n! Assert failed in readPixelsImpl (../../../src/libANGLE/renderer/vulkan/vk_helpers.cpp:8862): copyAspectFlags \u003d\u003d VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_COLOR_BIT\n```\n\nCan you take a look at that?  I would guess something needs to change in `SerializeFramebufferAttachment`.\n\n+Gert for any more insight.",

      "message": "The issue boils down to the fact that in this test we\u0027re trying to serialize a multisampled depth/stencil attachment. Vulkan readpixels currently can only read multisampled color attachments, but not depth or stencil, so that\u0027s the reason it fails. I guess we should add a fail expectation for MultisampleTest*Vulkan* and create a tracking issue for multisampled depth/stencil vulkan readpixels?",
