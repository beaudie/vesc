Changing the name/signature/semantics of the version negotiation is tougher, and so the sequence will be (within ANGLE):\n\n- Add a version-2 function with new name/etc.\n- Once version-2 is fully in place, remove version-1 functions.\n\nOn the Android side, it will be:\n\n- Use this function to determine if the ANGLE APK is version 1 or version 2.\n- If version 2, start using the rest of the version-2 API\n- At the same time we remove checking-for/using the version-1 API, replace the Android code that finds/uses this function with code that finds/uses the new function.\n\n\u003e Also, the decision of the \"best\" version to use seems like it doesn\u0027t have to be embedded into this API. ...\n\nI know that there are lots of ways to do version negotiation.

Arguments: API version, rules_FD + other file args, appName, and systemInfo. This would assume we can tag the systemInfo with the deviceMfr and deviceModel.\n\nOutputs: either an in/out for number of outputs, and an array of bools for rules results, if we need to return \"app choice\" vs \"system choice\". Or a single bool if we only want one result. This function currently doesn\u0027t seem to respect the app choice, but thinking ahead. If multiple choice, could be up to the caller to understand the array indexing scheme.\n\nOptionally we could return a code that indicates an unexpected error.\n\nThe reason I\u0027m proposing is that this could be future-proof towards using the exact same API for workaround selection. If we decide we want to go that way.\n\nIt would be nice if we could use the SystemInfo because it has a lot of other nice information other than deviceMfr and deviceModel. It shouldn\u0027t be hard to add a method to SystemInfo to patch in the device info. Or to just set it manually.\n\nWhat do you think? Maybe we should resolve some of this before moving on to the nitty gritty of the implementation details.\n\nI think either scheme work be forward-compatible with using protobufs as an optimization.",

Here\u0027s some thoughts before then ...\n\nI\u0027d like to back up first, before getting into all of the details ...\n\nYou say \"... for workaround selection, if we decide we want to go that way.\"  I thought you did want to go that way.  It might be good to determine that before looking at modifying this API (e.g. if you decide to not \"to go that way\", we\u0027ll save time/effort).\n\nBTW, have you looked at this doc lately?: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mdEPW25ZZPplRm5ybzYGye2oVxSqy-k9QkYpz2Rnt3s/edit?pli\u003d1#heading\u003dh.c0gzv7zc9e98\n\nIt has a section that looks at what \"functions\" are needed in terms of what-to-do, what inputs, what output, etc.  I was thinking of \"5. ANGLE determines what work-around(s) ANGLE will use for a given application and the current device\" as what ANGLE needed.  Is that close?\n\nJumping into some of the details...\n\nSomething that happened since Budapest is that Courtney put this into its own shared library that Android\u0027s EGL loader dlopen\u0027s and dlclose\u0027s.  Thus (I think--correct me if I\u0027m wrong), anything we pass down (like the deviceMfr and deviceModel, which can be queried by certain APIs that are above EGL) will be forgotten by the time ANGLE can call it.  I think that ANGLE needs to know that info, and we need to plumb it down to ANGLE.\n\nFrom our discussions in Budapest, I thought we agreed that we\u0027d have different functions for Android and for ANGLE calling into the rules processing.  The needs were different, and so different functions seemed appropriate.  This function is what Android needs now.  For example, the notion of an application preference was dropped strategically (we still encode any application-specific info into the rules file and not allow applications themselves to programmatically express a preference), and so it was dropped from this function signature as well.  It seems like ANGLE had different needs (less care for specific applications and more care for devices/drivers), and so a different function/signature is what I thought you preferred.  Do you really want to have one function that meets all needs?",

      "message": "\u003e I have lots of thoughts.  I\u0027m open.  Let\u0027s keep chatting ... perhaps in our meeting in a few minutes.  Here\u0027s some thoughts before then ...\n\u003e \n\u003e I\u0027d like to back up first, before getting into all of the details ...\n\u003e \n\u003e You say \"... for workaround selection, if we decide we want to go that way.\"  I thought you did want to go that way.  It might be good to determine that before looking at modifying this API (e.g. if you decide to not \"to go that way\", we\u0027ll save time/effort).\n\u003e \n\u003e BTW, have you looked at this doc lately?: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mdEPW25ZZPplRm5ybzYGye2oVxSqy-k9QkYpz2Rnt3s/edit?pli\u003d1#heading\u003dh.c0gzv7zc9e98\n\u003e \n\u003e It has a section that looks at what \"functions\" are needed in terms of what-to-do, what inputs, what output, etc.  I was thinking of \"5. ANGLE determines what work-around(s) ANGLE will use for a given application and the current device\" as what ANGLE needed.  Is that close?\n\nOh no we do. So we if we could leave the door open to it without a redesign of the API version that\u0027d be idea.\n\n\u003e Jumping into some of the details...\n\u003e \n\u003e Something that happened since Budapest is that Courtney put this into its own shared library that Android\u0027s EGL loader dlopen\u0027s and dlclose\u0027s.  Thus (I think--correct me if I\u0027m wrong), anything we pass down (like the deviceMfr and deviceModel, which can be queried by certain APIs that are above EGL) will be forgotten by the time ANGLE can call it.  I think that ANGLE needs to know that info, and we need to plumb it down to ANGLE.\n\nOK, good point. Also, we probably don\u0027t want to call system info collection twice if ANGLE is using this info for workarounds determination. That would leave two options for us:\n\n#1. we store the SystemInfo in the shared library that Courtney added and pass a handle to ANGLE on init.\n#2. we pass in the full SystemInfo to ANGLE on ANGLE init.\n\nIn either case, wouldn\u0027t you potentially want the full SystemInfo along with of device manufacturer/model? You\u0027d have access to the driver version. The device info could be folded into the struct as well. Are you even using the SystemInfo right now?\n\n\u003e From our discussions in Budapest, I thought we agreed that we\u0027d have different functions for Android and for ANGLE calling into the rules processing.  The needs were different, and so different functions seemed appropriate.  This function is what Android needs now.  For example, the notion of an application preference was dropped strategically (we still encode any application-specific info into the rules file and not allow applications themselves to programmatically express a preference), and so it was dropped from this function signature as well.  It seems like ANGLE had different needs (less care for specific applications and more care for devices/drivers), and so a different function/signature is what I thought you preferred.  Do you really want to have one function that meets all needs?\n\nWell, it\u0027s good if you dropped the app preference design. That means the rules system only has one output. I think the only thing that would need to change to make the APIs the same is to take a SystemInfo instead of device info. App name seems reasonable since in all cases ANGLE is running under an application layer. Sometimes it wouldn\u0027t be used in the rules file, and it isn\u0027t a part of the System info, but it does make sense for all our users.\n\nOh, and maybe return yes/no/error instead of yes/no. There could be some unexpected behaviour. Or add an error callback if we really want to get fancy.",
