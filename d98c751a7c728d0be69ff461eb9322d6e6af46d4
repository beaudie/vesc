If a vendor comes up with a product name like \"RTX Super Intelligent\" we could get tripped up if GL_RENDERER is added in.\n\nBetter yet, and preferably, to avoid issues with a vendor naming their card \"Beat this NVIDIA! 5000\", we can add a check for AMD/ATI in GL_RENDERER only before resorting to VENDOR_ID_UNKNOWN.\n\nThe latter better matches what the code actually intends to do.",
