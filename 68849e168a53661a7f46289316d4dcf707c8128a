If not, we could also throttle the test runner so it doesn\u0027t spawn N processes all at the same time, so whatever warmup is done on the first test has a little room to complete before a competing process starts.",

I wonder if we should instead just limit the number of max processes we spawn to 8 or something. Trying to think of a way to get the same result without maintaining a new flag.",

I misread the units in my sleepy haze, so I don\u0027t actually have a repro for this. It\u0027s not about 16 vs 8. It\u0027s about leaving some room for swiftshader\u0027s threads to work. On a 4 thread CPU, bot mode could use 2 for example. When not running no swiftshader, there\u0027s no point in not utilizing the cpu to the max.\n\nAn alternative is to parse --use-angle, but that wouldn\u0027t work if swiftshader is enabled in some other way.",
