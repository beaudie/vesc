      "message": "If you mean compressed data, I\u0027ve already checked that it has the same CRC in a previous round. I have been thinking of dumping the (partially) uncompressed data somewhere but it\u0027s hundreds of MB and even then it doesn\u0027t give us the full state (one possibility is something gets corrupted in the zlib library itself)\n\nIdeally I\u0027d love to have some kind of full dump that I could then investigate but that might be way more effort than I\u0027m willing to put into this (I\u0027m pretty close to giving up on this tbf, this is likely just a harness issue so pretty low impact)",
