      "message": "A nested 1-pixel memcpy seems like a place where we could possibly find a more performant path. Is there a way to copy more at once, given that every pixel we\u0027re copying in is the same? If it\u0027s a choice between having a single type-agnostic function and doing fast copies, is single type-agnostic function the right choice?",
