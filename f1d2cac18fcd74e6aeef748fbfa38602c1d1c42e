Since developers will be using this extension to implement texImage2D from an arbitrary source, they will need to be able to copy into levels other than level zero.",

I think we also need the equivalent of CopyImageDataEXT, which is analogous to glCopyTextureCHROMIUM.\n\nDoes EXT_copy_image handle things cube maps and volume textures?",

MipLevels are just the beginning. texSubImage3D takes an arbitrary level and depth and it also accepts a Canvas or Video element as input. I suppose you could always introduce a single level intermediate texture but that is suboptimal.",
