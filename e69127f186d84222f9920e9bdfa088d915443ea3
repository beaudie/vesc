      "message": "It\u0027s possible that the ImageHelper::mCurrentSingleClearValue optimization is no longer necessary after this change. Repeated clears can get deferred with this change.\n\nCharlie, did you implement that optimization for Manhattan? I\u0027d appreciate it if you could give this change a try (and disable that optimization) to see if this change is sufficient.",

      "message": "Just verified on pixel4 that the duplicate clear optimization is still needed. If removed, you see tons of logs of doing clear (with log added at ImageHelper::flushStagedUpdates line 5096).\n\nWhat that optimization does is that similar to mContentDefined, but did even further. It identifies that the content is a cleared value, regardless if that clear has been flushed or not. I thin your CL is only looking at the deferred clears, so they are two different optimizations.",
