      "message": "I ran a few traces with logs, and in some cases, for example angry_birds_2_launch I see about 50% reduction in vkQueueSubmit calls. In traces with few flush calls, the glFinish calls issued by the trace fixture itself is optimized out. In the case of angry_birds_2_launch, there are thousands of flush calls from the app itself, half of which are optimized out. I took a look at a few of those, and some are from loading where the app does `texture upload; upload; flush; upload; upload; flush`. Some of them are from glFenceSync calls in the beginning of the frame (something filament also noticed).\n\nRunning angry_birds_2_launch, I see ~3% CPU perf improvement, but that could also just be noise. I didn\u0027t run the full list of traces.\n\nI\u0027m considering following up with an overlay widget that logs vkQueueSubmit calls per frame.",
