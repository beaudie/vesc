      "message": "Might not be enough to check current index only. In the very least, this interacts badly with `EGL_ANGLE_prepare_swap_buffers`, even if no one other than ANGLE itself uses it (currently). This could be a loop over all images.\n\nAs an aside, not sure if this is worth it. The only place where it might be helpful is with `waitIdleBeforeSwapchainRecreation`, but isn\u0027t that fixed now? Can we just limit that workaround to older Android? Context: anglebug.com/5061",
