      "message": "I scheduled some time tomorrow to talk this over and hopefully make the review easier.\n\nA couple notes:\n\n- This generates correct (but a little incomplete) SPIR-V already for the debug, decorations and types/constants/variables sections of SPIR-V, but can\u0027t enable tests yet as it doesn\u0027t translate function bodies. That would be upcoming and more gradual than this change.\n- go/vangle-link-time-shader-compilation is the accompanying doc for the changes in this series (which I will complete as I work more on it)\n- I made this excluded from non-dcheck builds by default to avoid binary size bloat while both the direct and glslang paths co-exist.",
