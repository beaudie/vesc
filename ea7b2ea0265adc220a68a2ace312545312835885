      "message": "For the code in ContextMTL.mm, the issue is, on WatchOS (32bit), DirtyBits becomes a BitSetArray and there is no constructor that takes an int for BitSetArray. On 64bit DirtyBits becomes a BitSetT for which there is a constructor. Shabi suggested just use the code that doesn\u0027t use constexpr.\n\nFor the code in validationEGL.h I added a comment. The issue there is again on WatchOS where I think the assumption that on 32bit EGLint and EGLAttrib are the same was false.",
