It\u0027s not allowed to introduce dependencies on Chromium from third_party libraries like ANGLE to avoid problems with circular dependencies, so if/when we try to build this target from the Chromium side, we will probably have to duplicate the main .cpp file like we had to in angle_end2end_tests_main.cc and angle_unittest_main.cc in Chromium\u0027s src/gpu/.",
