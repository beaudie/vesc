      "message": "It would be \"possible\" - if you wanted to do it by trace, we would need an expectations file and a format that could specify flaky or something like that. I think if you tried to describe the risk here: a trace creeps in that is slightly flaky when it shouldn\u0027t be, you\u0027ll quickly realize it\u0027s not something that\u0027s a big risk. If a trace is slightly flaky, we\u0027d just suppress it and move on, we wouldn\u0027t ever debug it to see why it\u0027s flaky. And IIRC I haven\u0027t seen any case where we\u0027d have a regression where a test becomes flaky because of a bad change. What I\u0027d suggest is that the cost/benefit of enabling inexact matching is heavily skewed towards benefit. We could potentially limit it to only some configs, like !Android, but even that I don\u0027t really see a real reason for, as if a trace ever had slight flaky pixels on Android we\u0027d still want to run it, and probably wouldn\u0027t debug why it\u0027s slightly non-deterministic.",
