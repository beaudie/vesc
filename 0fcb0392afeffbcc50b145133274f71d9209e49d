(It took me a while to remember how to change args of embedded projects in a universal and safe way).\n\nThere are now have two unrelated mechanisms for configuring embedded GN projects. Most things are being done with build_overrides, but that only works for free-floating global variables, not for args. I forgot about default_args (in Skia\u0027s .gn), which appear to solve this particular problem.",
