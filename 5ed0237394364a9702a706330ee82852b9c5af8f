      "message": "In my understanding libANGLE should always be a DLL (shared_library). It\u0027s undesirable to duplicate its code into both libEGL and libGLESv2. Is there some reason this change isn\u0027t being made in this CL?",

      "message": "If libGLESv2_static\u0027s dependency on libANGLE prevents libANGLE from being a DLL, we should reconsider whether libGLESv2_static should be a static library. Since it\u0027s only used by non-essential tests at this point, it would be OK to break those tests, or comment them out temporarily, in order to enable this refactoring.",
