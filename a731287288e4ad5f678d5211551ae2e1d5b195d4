Since Chromium provides a blob cache, ANGLE shouldn\u0027t be caching anything itself.\n\nI imagine by \"chromium manages shader cache by itself\" you are talking about the same blob cache I\u0027m talking about. In that case, ANGLE shouldn\u0027t be doing anything more than put blobs in Chromium\u0027s blob cache.",
