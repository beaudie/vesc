      "message": "Hm, I don\u0027t like how this duplicates the RenderTarget extraction in Buffer11::PackStorage::packPixels. One idea is to store an ANGLEFormat in TextureHelper11 instead of a DXGI format. Although I\u0027m beginning to wonder exactly what the difference between an ANGLE format and DXGI format is, and when they should be used.",

      "message": "Well, at its heart an ANGLE format contains necessary parameters for implementing one or more GL formats. The DXGI formats are just formats for specific resources and views in the D3D API. Sometimes it\u0027s not as clear which one should be used to make decisions about more parameters, but I wouldn\u0027t get too hung up on that. I\u0027ve developed these patches to lay a low-risk path to the functionality we want - I think if there are no functional issues in this code, there are higher-value things for us to chase rather than polish the design too much.",

      "message": "ANGLE puts a lot of effort into keeping the code pretty streamlined so I\u0027d like to maintain that overriding goal. In this case, take a look at replacing the DXGI format in TextureHelper11 with the ANGLE format. Also see if you can get rid of the GetDesc call, which was a bit of a hack.",
