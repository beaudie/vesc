My idea with the smoke test was to kind of \"short-circuit\" perftests by running this test with a short timeout. If this isn\u0027t going to work this way then this serves a different purpose, and then do you find it useful to have it?",

      "message": "Sorry, when you say \"then do you find it useful to have it\", what are you referring to? And can you identify what the primary concern was with the short timeout - was it to save bots from an expensive failure cycle? We can enforce that in other ways by having a max # failures or other heuristic potentially. I\u0027m not too particular on what we do except I think the smoke test way wasn\u0027t the best way because it relied on a specific trace + test suite and there may be ways that get the same result without using as much time talking to the device.",

      "message": "\u003e And can you identify what the primary concern was with the short timeout - was it to save bots from an expensive failure cycle?\nYes, I did that specifically to avoid expensive failure cycle (both in terms of device usage AND presubmit latency which has implications on development cycle) that we were running into previously. I have nothing against \"let\u0027s drop it, it doesn\u0027t seem to be useful enough\" though, which is why I\u0027m asking if you think it\u0027s useful to have it this way. If it can help us cut at least on the presubmit latency even without reducing device usage (notifying CL that the smoke test failed shortly after it happened but still keep running the other tests) then maybe it\u0027s still useful. I don\u0027t know if that is what is going to happen or if it just silently keeps running other tests to completion if this one fails, and if that\u0027s the case I don\u0027t see how that is going to be helpful to people.\n\n\n\u003e without using as much time talking to the device.\nFrom test run on this CL (https://logs.chromium.org/logs/angle/buildbucket/cr-buildbucket/8811273034674091569/+/u/angle_android_helper_tests_on_Android_device_Pixel_4/stdout)\n```\nI17:04:43.021219Z Running smoke test (TracePerfTest.Run/vulkan_words_with_friends_2)\nI17:04:43.185854Z Synced 1 trace files (1.7MB, 0 files already ok) in 0.2s\nI17:04:45.221764Z Smoke test passed\n```\n\nSo the entire sequence takes ~2 seconds. Do you find that significant?",
