      "message": "Ah, that\u0027s an interesting way to do this.\n\nIf this suite fails, would it stop running other test suites? My idea with the smoke test was to kind of \"short-circuit\" perftests by running this test with a short timeout. If this isn\u0027t going to work this way then this serves a different purpose, and then do you find it useful to have it?",

      "message": "Sorry, when you say \"then do you find it useful to have it\", what are you referring to? And can you identify what the primary concern was with the short timeout - was it to save bots from an expensive failure cycle? We can enforce that in other ways by having a max # failures or other heuristic potentially. I\u0027m not too particular on what we do except I think the smoke test way wasn\u0027t the best way because it relied on a specific trace + test suite and there may be ways that get the same result without using as much time talking to the device.",
