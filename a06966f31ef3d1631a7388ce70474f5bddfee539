      "message": "This almost implements the rest of the spec, minus feedback loop detection, the ban list, and a few per-draw checks.\n\nAfter this change is when things get exciting! By implementing the extension as a frontend feature, plus a few tweaks to the compiler, I think we can get it working quickly on all the tilers, including Metal. We just need two more relatively small backends: EXT_framebuffer_fetch and EXT_shader_pixel_local_storage.\n\nAdd a fourth backend that uses texelFetch an glTextureBarrier and the extension is fully implemented!",
