      "message": "I\u0027d recommend not passing this flag as well. There\u0027s -Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor which warns if a class has virtual methods, no virtual dtor _and is the target of a delete statement_. That\u0027s a much better, lower-noise warning and it\u0027s hence on by default already. -Wnon-virtual-dtor in practice shouldn\u0027t give you any additional protection while causing more busywork in some cases.",
