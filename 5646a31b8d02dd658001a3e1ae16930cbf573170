      "message": "Ok this doesn\u0027t work, and it\u0027s just luckily passing tests. The next change exposes the issue in this change.\n\nThe problem is the way D/S layout change is deferred to the end of render pass. Basically the ImageHelper::mLayout is not set at the beginning of RP, so the render target thinks contents are undefined (through FramebufferVk::syncState) before it ends the render pass (in the same function) and starts a new one.\n\nI\u0027m going to bite the bullet and just move mContentDefined to ImageHelper to avoid hackishly fixing this.",
