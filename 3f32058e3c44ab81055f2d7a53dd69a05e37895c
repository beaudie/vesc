      "message": "I think I would invert this a bit. I would call ensureImageInitialized() here. And then just initialize the necessary bits from imageIndex. The mImage and mImage validity check can flip into an ASSERT. This should hopefully simplify the code.\n\nNote we always have to have a valid image here. We\u0027re either about to render to this image or we\u0027re about to read from it. Things get more complicated in ES 3.0 but let\u0027s burn that bridge when we come to it.",
