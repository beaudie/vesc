      "message": "Yes, I\u0027ve seen it, and the failing test seems completely unrelated. win-trace-rel starts failing with the previous CL, but with only one test failing. All I can see is that in the CL before that the composition of the test batches is different, so I\u0027d suspect a state leak that triggers a failure depending on the order the tests are run in. I was not able to reproduce this failure on Linux though. \n\nAnother thing I noted: win-trace-rel has 10 execution steps (9. being the trace capture/replay tests) and a run-time of about 15 min, linux-trace-rel has only 9 steps and a run-time of ~2 min, i.e. it doesn\u0027t seem to run the capture/replay step. (I wanted to compare whether the batches are the same there)",
