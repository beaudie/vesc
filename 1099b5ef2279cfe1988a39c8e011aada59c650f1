      "message": "These swapBuffers() were to make sure that we were appropriately dealing with render pass store ops for depth/and or stencil (in this and the other tests that you replaced these in).\n\nAt the time, we actually were better than the Pixel 4 driver (i.e. the content analysis team found that we eliminated a render pass for a real game(s)).  I don\u0027t want to lose that ability with this/follow-on CL(s)?",
