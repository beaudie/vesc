      "message": "Looks strange.\n\nWhy need to call `threadCleanup()` when no Context is current, but do **not** need when Context from some other Display is Current?\n\nI think that we need to call `threadCleanup()` for all Displays to cleanup from any previous use by these Displays.\n\nI still think that my 2 CLs simpler and handle more cases. I do not know why you decided to rewrite what I originally proposed? Something was originally wrong with my CLs?",

I think it is better to do this rather than keep Context current to a terminated thread. Need to check spec. about this.",
