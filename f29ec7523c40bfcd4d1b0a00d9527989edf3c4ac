      "message": "This set is just `.angledata.gz` as there isn\u0027t a lot of benefit in making trace_json reference itself :) but yeah would be nice to have angledata listed in there somewhere. The other thing that keeps bugging me is that the file name is hard-coded in the cpp itself:\n`InitializeReplay4(\"arknights.angledata.gz\",..);` which would be nice to fix together with what you\u0027re suggesting (but outside of scope of this change)",
