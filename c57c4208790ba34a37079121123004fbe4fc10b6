Perhaps you could say \"Contributors to the OpenGL ES 3.1, GLSL ES 3.1, and ARB_texture_multisample specifications, on which this extension is based\". I think that it should be stated somewhere in this extension specification that it\u0027s based on functionality from those specs -- maybe at the end of the Overview spec. Since XXX_texture_storage_multisample was never promoted, and the draft spec\u0027s not publicly visible, I recommend not referring to it.",

The main reason to use ES 3.1 multisampled textures seems to be to write a custom resolve shader. There doesn\u0027t seem to be another advantage over using multisampled renderbuffers. They definitely do not have the property that on tiled rendering architectures, the multisampled storage can be left on-chip.\n\nI\u0027m sorry for not realizing this until now.
