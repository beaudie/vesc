      "message": "\"store a dictionary that indexes similarly to ImageDesc...\", I guess you are thinking cases that this repeated clear pattern occur on the different layer/level and want to optimize that as well? I intended this to be a narrow optimization though, mainly because gfxbench is doing this. There is no evidence that this usage pattern occurred on multi-level/layer textures and alternatively clearing different levels. It is pretty silly thing for app to do it this way and I would hesitate to optimize that. But we are talking about gfxbench, so it worth it. If we use a dictionary etc, now the cost is a bit higher (due to dictionary lookup) and a bit more complicated, all for an unknown benefit. That is why I picked a solution I think is simple and effective and solve the specific perf issue we have.",

      "message": "The whole point of this fix is to address the specific usage scenario that gfxbench is using, which is a single leveled texture. Use of a white texture is reasonable, but clear it every frame without other writes is not reasonable. To use such a white texture with mipmap and repeatedly clear all levels is even more silly. If anyone find a real app doing this way and we care about that, I have no object to optimize it. But right now we start with optimize an imagery silly usage case is something I am trying to avoid here.\n\nThe fix is pretty straight forward: Remember we just had a standalone clear call and reset that clear as soon as there is other operations on the imageHelper object. Other operations are:\n1) Render to it: CommandBufferHelper::imageWrite\n2) CopyTexSubImage etc that are outside RP modification: ContextVk::onImageWrite\n3) Respecify the level via glTexImage call:  ImageHelper::releaseStagingBuffer, ImageHelper::removeSingleSubresourceStagedUpdates\n\nIf we get another standalone clear call, we check against the current state, if we believe we have the exact cleared color already, then re just drop the clear call.\n\nLet me know if a ddoc is really desired.",
