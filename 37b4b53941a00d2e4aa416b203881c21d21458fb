      "message": "How does this work with Jamie\u0027s CLs that defers clears?   Can they work together better to handle this case (merge the deferred clears), or does the deferred clears stuff not get invoked due to how gfxbench is doing things?\n\nJamie\u0027s CL:\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/2142711",

      "message": "This seems like a pretty narrow optimization. Why don\u0027t you store a dictionary that indexes similarly to ImageDesc and stores the flushed clear value for a particular level? Also writes to the texture would have to invalidate this cache - it gets tricky.\n\nI wanted to wait on review and became concerned you might go down a different direction if I didn\u0027t speak up. Similar to the problem ddocs attempt to solve.",
