      "message": "If maskedClearColor, you shouldn\u0027t clear colors here. See the `else` part of this `if` with a similar (stricter) condition.\n\nSince this wasn\u0027t caught on the bots, can you please write a regression test? The test should do:\n\n- Mask a few color channels\n- Draw\n- Clear\n- Draw\n\nThe masked channels shouldn\u0027t have cleared. I believe with the current change they would. See MaskedScissoredClearTest for inspiration, though you don\u0027t need to parameterize the test like that, a single scenario is probably sufficient to trigger the bug.",
