I\u0027m going to put this CL on a shelf for the moment; the priority from AGI has lowered.\n\nI created a working implementation for renderbuffers, and discovered how to do that for buffers as well.  I have some hacked test code, with notes of how to clean it up.\n\nThere\u0027s a portability issue w.r.t. casting Vulkan handles to uint64_t, which is required by the Vulkan extension.  I found some LunarG code that seems to do the trick (see: third_party/vulkan-validation-layers/src/layers/cast_utils.h).",
