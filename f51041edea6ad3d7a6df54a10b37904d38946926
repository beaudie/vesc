      "message": "From looking and chatting with Geoff, It looks like Geoff recently rolled VMA in the Chromium repository (https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator).  This is much newer than what ANGLE is currently using, and is fairly close to top-of-tree.  This CL simply changes ANGLE\u0027s DEPS file to use that version of VMA.  We can talk more about this in Wednesday\u0027s SCRUM.",
