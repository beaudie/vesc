Then, I can take more time to have a better-tested CL to enable the coherent extension on Arm/QCOM/IMG.",

      "message": "Yes, in particular, 3 games are checking the substring \"GL_EXT_shader_framebuffer_fetch\" within the string of all supported extensions.  Since \"GL_EXT_shader_framebuffer_fetch\" is found within \"GL_EXT_shader_framebuffer_fetch_non_coherent\", the games assume that \"GL_EXT_shader_framebuffer_fetch\" is supported.\n\nThese 3 games will all have problems on your GPU.  We\u0027ve reached out to 2 of them so far (they said they were checking extensions, which is why I dug deeper and determined they are checking in a wrong way).",
