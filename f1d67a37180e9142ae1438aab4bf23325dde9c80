      "message": "They caused compilation issues when I included DXProgrammableCapture.h and dxgidebug.h in debug.cpp. I wanted to put them in debug.cpp (instead of platform.h) since they shouldn\u0027t really be used anywhere else.\n\nI think the best fix long-term is to solve the compilation issues caused when you don\u0027t undef near/far, so I\u0027ve tried to do that. I fixed the only compilation issue that I hit, in src/compiler/translator/Initialize.cpp. Are there other more subtle problems?",

      "message": "I\u0027d rather keep all platform-specific includes in platform.h even if it is only used from one place.\n\nSince it wont be a problem to undef near and far once all the Windows includes are done, I\u0027d rather keep doing that.  It helps reduce the number of platform specific gotchas, especially since near and far are often used in computer graphics.",
