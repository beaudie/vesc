      "message": "They caused compilation issues when I included DXProgrammableCapture.h and dxgidebug.h in debug.cpp. I wanted to put them in debug.cpp (instead of platform.h) since they shouldn\u0027t really be used anywhere else.\n\nI think the best fix long-term is to solve the compilation issues caused when you don\u0027t undef near/far, so I\u0027ve tried to do that. I fixed the only compilation issue that I hit, in src/compiler/translator/Initialize.cpp. Are there other more subtle problems?",
