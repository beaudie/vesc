In summary:\n\n- Got rid of the duplicate ShaderVariables\n- I/O blocks are no longer tracked both as interface blocks and varyings.  They are now just varyings.\n- Removed some unnecessary code\n\nSome failures are addressed in the next change in this chain. There are a few corner cases that need further investigation.",
