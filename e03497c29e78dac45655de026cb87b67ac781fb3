      "message": "FYI, I did this so I can capture gl_Position rotated and flipped and then reuse the unused parts of the buffer to issue an indirect dispatch call post-render-pass to undo those changes in the final buffer. That may or may not optimize gl_Position capture (probably faster VS vs to some degree concurrent (with next RP) compute call for correction), but would get rid of one reserved varying (and resolve a GS varying limit issue). FYI, non of our traces capture gl_Position, so it looks like applications prefer to capture some custom varying for position instead.\n\nThat said, I don\u0027t have time to pursue that for now, so let\u0027s put this on ice.",
