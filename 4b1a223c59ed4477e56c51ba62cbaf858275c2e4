(that is it won\u0027t affect your other CL?)\n\nSo if count is 1, it copies 1, if count is N \u003e 1, it copies N - 1? Is it possible to confirm the bug with Intel?\n\nAnyway, I would at least put the size of the last copy to 1 (unfortunately 0 is not allowed by the spec), so everywhere else that is not affected by the bug will spend less time copying.",
