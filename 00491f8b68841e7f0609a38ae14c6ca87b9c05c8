      "message": "Your test is still unfair. The case with \"initializer in definition\" has the chance (even if not implemented) that the initialization is done once by the driver. The case with \"initializer in code\" is run 8x8x8 time, even though even a 1x1x1 dispatch would have cleared the whole array. In the latter case you are doing the initialization possibly 512 times more often.\n\nHowever, if this is intentional (you know that no driver is optimizing \"initializer in definition\" especially), then it\u0027s ok (I presume you want the code to run long enough to reduce the measurement error).",

The driver is able to perform the \"initializer in definition\" case by sharing the work among all invocations and eventually initialize every element only once.
