This code is for when we\u0027re re-doing a texture and the updatedExtents (e.g. what was previously used as the bufferRowLength) are smaller than the compressed block width/height.  The checking for a multiple of the compressed block width/height was done previously, when something like glCompressedTexImage2D was called).",
