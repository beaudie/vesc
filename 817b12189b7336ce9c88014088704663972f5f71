      "message": "There is a bug here, that in fact this change fixes. Could you please write a test for it?\n\n- Create a buffer that has a shadow\n- Record a command that changes the buffer but make sure it doesn\u0027t get submitted\n- Use a command that verifies the index range. This should have used waitForIdle just like mapRangeImpl does which incurs a flush before mapping the buffer. The bug is that finishRunningCommands doesn\u0027t flush. (This change already fixes that bug)",
