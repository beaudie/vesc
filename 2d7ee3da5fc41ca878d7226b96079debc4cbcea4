      "message": "Since we\u0027re querying  ID3D11Device1 a couple times, it\u0027d be great to put it as a member of Renderer11, probably right next to mDevice. You can query for it at the end of Renderer11::initializeD3DDevice and release it in Renderer11::release.\n\nI don\u0027t think there is any drawback to always preferring to open the shared resource on ID3D11Device1 so we could do a pattern like:\n\n    if (mDevice1)\n    {\n        result \u003d mDevice1-\u003eOpenSharedResource1(...)\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        result \u003d mDevice-\u003eOpenSharedResource(...)\n    }",
