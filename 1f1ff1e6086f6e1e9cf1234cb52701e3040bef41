      "message": "Hmm.  Depends on the WSI implementation.  It may not be safe to destroy swapchain 1 so soon (e.g. vkQueuePresentKHR is supposed to queue the present, to occur after all rendering has completed and when the next vblank occurs).  There\u0027s the spec and then there are the implementations.  Spec-wise, it would be much-safer to destroy swapchain 1 after you\u0027ve presented an image from swapchain 2.  Perhaps you might get away with destroying it after you\u0027ve acquired an image from swapchain 2.\n\nIt might be good for me to re-read the spec language (that I had a hand in writing/editing) and think some more about this.",

      "message": "Thanks Ian. My impression from the spec was that as soon as the image is returned to the swapchain, it\u0027s safe to delete it (and the driver would keep track of when the image is actually presented and is allowed to be freed). I\u0027m not sure how either of waiting for one present from swapchain 2 or one acquire from it would ensure a vblank has passed for the present that was called for the last image of swapchain 1.\n\nCorrect me if I\u0027m wrong, but isn\u0027t it possible for something like this happen?\n\n- Create swapchain 1 with 3 images\n- Acquire image 1 and present it\n- Acquire image 2 and present it\n- VBlank: image 1 is presented, image 2 is queued for present\n- Create swapchain 2\n- Acquire image 3 from swapchain 2 and present it\n- VBLANK: image 2 is presented, image 3 is queued for present\n\nIn such a case, even after both one acquire and present involving swapchain 2, an image from swapchain 1 (image 2) is pending present.",
