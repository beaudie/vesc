      "message": "Hey I\u0027m catching up on this, sorry for the slow response. I have a couple questions and I want to make sure we get this right.\n\nIs there a reason this can\u0027t live in ANGLE, if we could configure the max texture size to something else? Putting workarounds like this in the passthrough command decoder is not ideal because it duplicates validation and bugs often arise from differences in ANGLE\u0027s state and what\u0027s exposed to the GPU process clients.\n\nI think the current emulation of this in the command decoder isn\u0027t enough, a bunch of validation relies on the max texture size (see references to max2DtextureSize in https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/angle/src/libANGLE/Caps.h).",
