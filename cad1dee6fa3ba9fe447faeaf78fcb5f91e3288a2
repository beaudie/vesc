      "message": "Tim: OK. I have a proposal.\n\nIf you want to put per-object counters in something, store them in the object itself. Once per swap we iterate the set of profiled objects and accumulate into a cumulative counter in PerfCounters. Everything in PerfCounters should be specific to a whole context, not indexed to an object. You can iterate the list of programs by repurposing getProgramsForCapture into a read-only iteration function.\n\nWe can keep the printf logging you have here also using the resource manager iteration.",
