A couple points:\n\n- Please add tests similarly to those in ProgramInterfaceTest.cpp.  Basically the test would create a shader, destroy it, and recreate it.\n- I realize this is a big deal with the glslang path, but could you please give SPIR-V gen a try and see how much this affects application load times (or whatever other metric you are using to evaluate this)? I do agree that having a cache is good, just wanted to know what the numbers look like.",
