The weird thing was that even though I was #defining MAYBE_foo as DISABLED_foo, it would still appear as MAYBE_foo in the gtest output so I\u0027m not sure I understand what\u0027s going on. There isn\u0027t any instance of MAYBE used with TEST_P in Chrome, so maybe it doesn\u0027t work because of the way TEST_P is implemented.",
