I created a GN build script which works fine locally, but I don\u0027t know yet how to add a third party lib. I found the DEPS file, but I don\u0027t know if it is allowed to add something which is not yet mirrored on googlesource.com.\nI don\u0027t mind to add that library in a separate CL or to amend this CL.",
