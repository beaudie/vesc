      "message": "I obviously don\u0027t remember at all what I had in mind a year ago! But reading back the comments, I don\u0027t think the intention was to store the alignment. The (or part of the) idea is to align the header at allocation time such that `data()` automatically becomes aligned. Does that make sense?\n\nFor example, say data needs to be 16-byte aligned, and the header is (for the purpose of this exercise) 12 bytes.  Then you would need to make an allocation at a 16k+4 offset, which means data() is at a 16k+16 offset (i.e. 16-byte aligned).",
