      "message": "I obviously don\u0027t remember at all what I had in mind a year ago! But reading back the comments, I don\u0027t think the intention was to store the alignment. The (or part of the) idea is to align the header at allocation time such that `data()` automatically becomes aligned. Does that make sense?\n\nFor example, say data needs to be 16-byte aligned, and the header is (for the purpose of this exercise) 12 bytes.  Then you would need to make an allocation at a 16k+4 offset, which means data() is at a 16k+16 offset (i.e. 16-byte aligned).",

      "message": "Yes, this all makes sense. I\u0027ve reworked this a few times now and the issue is that the guard-band checks live in the Allocation class (and originate from the private Header class). The current fails on 32-bit are due to this where the trailing guard-band is overwritten by data. The guard-band check has to be aware of the alignment, but it\u0027s quite ugly to try and pipe it in everywhere.\n\nI may clean up something else for a bit to chew on a better way to handle this but let me know if you have any particular ideas.",
