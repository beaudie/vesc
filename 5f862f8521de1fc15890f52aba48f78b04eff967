      "message": "Maybe these functions don\u0027t need to have a resolved link either? The output location fields in mState are updated when link is called, before link is resolved. Or is the idea that queries need to first check whether link can be resolved successfully on the backend?",

      "message": "I think anything that occurs during or after the link operation would need the link resolved. A better name might be \"mLinkPending\" rather than \"mLinkResolved\" since mLinkResolved \u003d true means either there has never been a link or the link is complete. But you\u0027re right about bindAttribLocation probably.",

      "message": "I think most of the queries just need Program::link to have been called, but resolving the link on the backend might not be strictly necessary. This is the case at least if we can trust that the link always succeeds on the backend after the validation done in ANGLE. Also setting state that only affects the next link doesn\u0027t really depend on having completed the previous link. Of course optimizing repeated linking of the same program object probably isn\u0027t worth much effort.\n\nThe code could be clearer if the linked state would be more clearly separated from unlinked state though.",
