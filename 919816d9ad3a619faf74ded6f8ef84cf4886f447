      "message": "Why is this a member variable when it is only used in drawLineLoop? If it is to avoid allocations, I worry that the call to resize might cause reallocations anyway. Keeping it it between runs might avoid allocating several times per drawLineLoop (exponential grow etc) however I think you can prove that the resulting index data will have at most (original Index data size) + 1 elements so we can reserve that directly.",
