      "message": "Funny, I was just going to see if you are interested in reviewing this!\n\nI\u0027m not quite so sure I know all the reasons the different paths could be taken. I think mips where the dimensions are not a multiple of block sizes is where we can\u0027t straight out memcpy, is there any other reason? I remember you fixed a few issues in the past with such mip dimensions, so there should be end2end tests. I\u0027ll do a run of the tests to make sure all paths are hit.",
