      "message": "@Ken, I need help regarding feedback loop here. See the test added in this change. Are these draw calls expected to fail due to feedback loop? This is a simplified version of a fuzzer test which in turn is a simplified version of conformance2/textures/misc/immutable-tex-render-feedback.html.\n\n@Jamie, the RenderTarget pulled out of the render target cache has an invalid vtable. Given that the crash only happens after a state change, do you think it\u0027s possible there is a stale entry in the cache?",

      "message": "Yeah, certainly possible we have a bug when rendering with feedback loops. To confirm this is 100% a feedback loop in both cases and should result in undefined fragment values. It should not crash or do anything like that.",
