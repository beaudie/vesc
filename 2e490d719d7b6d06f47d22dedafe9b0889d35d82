      "message": "Shahbaz Youssefi, you mentioned we need the following tests (copying these requirements from https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/3329603/4..11/src/tests/gl_tests/FramebufferTest.cpp#b3691 -\n\n  - The drawing tests are all over the place, any would do. Can use the essl1_shaders::fs::Checkered() shader to make sure flip is working.\n  - The blit/resolve stuff can be found in BlitFramebufferANGLETest.cpp\n  - The copy tex image stuff can be found in CopyTexImageTest.cpp\n  - glCopyTextureCHROMIUM and glCopySubTextureCHROMIUM (see tests in CopyTextureTest.cpp)\n  - Also to make sure sub-copy offsets are adjusted correctly, need to test glCopyTexSubImage too.\n\nIn this CL, I added tests to BlitFramebufferANGLETest that exercise blit with y-flip flag set. Also, I added one test to FramebufferTest_ES31 to test drawing with further multisampling and y-flip flag (I hope this suits into the requirement for drawing test).\n\nBut I have doubts about other tests in with glCopyTexImage, glCopyTexSubImage, glCopyTextureCHROMIUM, and glCopySubTextureCHROMIUM. Can you suggest any particular tests that I can reuse? For example, I tried to reuse the CopyTexImageTest.RGBAToRGB (see RGBAToRGBWithMesaFlipY in this CL) test and kept the same expected result as the original test, but applied the y-flip flag.... And the test passed. I thought it should fail when the result is verified.",
