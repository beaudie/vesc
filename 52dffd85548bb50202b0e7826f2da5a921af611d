      "message": "A few questions for you:\n1) What happens to unused clip distance varyings? Are they removed before the final pass?\n2) Does that allow skipping? I.e. using clip planes 0, 4, 6 without exporting varyings for all of them?\n---\nI\u0027m a little concerned about the total number of exported varyings. Can we still export up to MAX_VARYING_VECTORS when using clip distance? If not, how limited are we?",
