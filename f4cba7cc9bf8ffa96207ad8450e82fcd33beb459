      "message": "Thanks Jonah for helping reproduce locally.\nI made some speculative fixes. And linux_angle_deqp_rel_ng is now green.\nI think the change that makes the difference might be in renderergl_utls.cpp enabling feature, instead of calling ReinitializeFeaturesAtGPUSwitch to get rid of redundant code, call the ANGLE_FEATURE_CONDITION directly. In that case there could be issues when getting system info multiple times.\nThanks for the review.",
