      "message": "Hi Geoff, I sill can\u0027t successfully setup my linux ozone environment. But my previous change is very simple. I suspect the bot failure is caused by changing surface type from EGL_WINDOW_BIT | EGL_PBUFFER_BIT to EGL_PBUFFER_BIT. Maybe some linux ozone platform only supports EGL_WINDOW_BIT? So I did the current change. Can you help to trigger the Linux FYI Ozone(Intel) to see if it can pass that bot? I don\u0027t know how to do that. It seems that linux-lozone-rel/linux_angle_ozone_rel_ng are not that bot. Thanks. ",
