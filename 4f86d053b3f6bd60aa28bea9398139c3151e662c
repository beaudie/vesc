      "message": "mActiveUniformBlockBindings is essentially same as mUniformBlockBindings. They are just different expressions on same information, respectively bitset and array. It took me pretty much time to figure this out. Probably I will have to re-do this if I forget it in future. Truly bitset generally has better performance than array on iterating elements. Throughout the entire source tree, the significant usage of mActiveUniformBlockBindings is only here. Considering that people hardly write a shader using hundreds of uniform blocks, and ProgramGL::load is not likely to be called very frequently, I feel it can be removed to make life easier.",

      "message": "Thank you for your explanation.\n\nThe array and the bitset are not the same information - the bitset does not contain all the necessary information of the array. The bitset is a purely an acceleration structure, for faster iteration. I understand currently it doesn\u0027t seem very useful; I think if we ever add an iteration of the uniform blocks in the code other than in Load/Save binaries, then we would need to re-add the bitset if you remove it here. Hence I would feel better if we left it alone for now.\n\nIf you\u0027re concerned that it\u0027s hard to understand, we could add a comment; I guess I don\u0027t feel it\u0027s particularly hard to understand. Sorry for the trouble!",
