      "message": "I\u0027ve found this error particularly annoying with suppressions where parts of one suppression covers another suppression with different conditions (like Vulkan vs SwiftShader).\n\nThe expectation files are _proabably_ going to become a mess though, so not sure how I feel about it.\n\nAbout the inconvenience mentioned in the commit message, maybe it\u0027s a workflow thing? What I normally do for it is:\n\n```\n# Get the roll CL (short cut `d3` in gerrit):\n$ git fetch https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle refs/changes/... \u0026\u0026 git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD\n$ vim \u003cexpectations file\u003e\n$ git commit --amend  # remove autoroller footer, including Change-Id\n$ git cl upload\n```\n\nThat vs:\n\n```\n$ vim \u003cexpectations file\u003e\n$ git commit  # Add Bug tag\n$ git cl upload\n```\n\nis a very small difference.\n\n---\n\nDon\u0027t get me wrong, I don\u0027t like the \"unused\" warning, it\u0027s annoyed me many times before. But I\u0027m neutral on this change, if you don\u0027t mind, I\u0027d like to defer this decision to @ynovikov@chromium.org who deals with infra a lot.",
