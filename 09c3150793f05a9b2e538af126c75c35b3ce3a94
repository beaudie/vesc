I also added a large comment to try to explain pre-rotation better.\n\nI want you to take a look at the current state before I do more.  Not all of the methods end up being used, and I\u0027m not convinced it\u0027s wise to save rotated extents in ImageHelper (since mostly, the non-rotated extents are used).",
