      "message": "PTAL again. dEQP had some tests that used a shader with `int z[100][101][102]` so I had to bump up the limit. Technically 4MB is enough, but we use a std140 encoder to get the size of that which gives 16MB. They are both equally crazy large so doesn\u0027t really matter IMO.\n\nFWIW, the test only calls `length()` on `z`, so it\u0027s not actually using that much memory but we don\u0027t DCE at the moment to know that.",
