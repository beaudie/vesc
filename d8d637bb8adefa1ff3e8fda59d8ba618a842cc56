      "message": "Hey Mohan! Thanks for the optimization, but can you give us some context? There\u0027s a tradeoff here. If link happens at glUseProgramStages, it\u0027ll be done early (but perhaps redundantly). If it\u0027s done at draw time, you get hitching. Is there a way to keep linking at glUseProgramStages somehow yet avoid the redundancy? Like keep whatever was linked between stages A and B on first call, and only do the link between B and C on the second call?",
