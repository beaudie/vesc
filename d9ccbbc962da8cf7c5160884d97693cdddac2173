But, per http://www.khronos.org/registry/egl/extensions/EXT/EGL_EXT_platform_base.txt\n\n    All attribute names in \u003cattrib_list\u003e are immediately followed by the\n    corresponding desired value. The list is terminated with EGL_NONE. The\n    \u003cattrib_list\u003e is considered empty if either \u003cattrib_list\u003e is NULL or if\n    its first element is EGL_NONE. This specification defines no valid\n    attribute names for \u003cattrib_list\u003e.\n\nit seems like it\u0027s intended to be a list. Is it OK to have an attribute with no value?\n\nOr did you just mean to also define 0x3203-0x3205 as D3D9, D3D11, WARP, but also keep the _TYPE_EXT one?",
