      "message": "I wouldn\u0027t reuse this function for this purpose. This will close the RP for _any_ image that\u0027s been used in it. So if the RP samples from some image and that image gets deleted, this change closes the RP which it doesn\u0027t need to.\n\nI think we should track the attachment ImageHelpers separately (or rather duplicated-ly) in the RP, so that this end-RP-on-delete only happens for attachment images.\n\nCurrently we don\u0027t care about color attachments at end RP time, so you might as well only store the D/S attachment and compare against that.\n\n---\n\nI actually have a slightly better idea here. Say the RP tracks all its attachments:\n\n    FramebufferAttachmentsVector\u003cImageHelper *\u003e attachments;\n\nThere\u0027s actually no need to close the RP when an attachment is deleted. We just need to set attachments[index] \u003d nullptr. Later at endRP time, we make sure the image helper is not nullptr before accessing it.\n\nThat also obviates the need to swallow the error in releaseImage.",
