We know about 1 extension at this point.  The conservative, though still hacky work-around is to just add 1 for the 2nd call.  We could add more than 1.",

      "message": "This was my suggestion. The point is that the vector below is not taking too much memory, and is freed pretty quickly afterwards. It doesn\u0027t hurt to allocate a few slots more.\n\nIn reality, this sort of error shouldn\u0027t happen at all, and knowing the race condition is in Android and it only affects the extension list by a count of 1, I think having this ++ is a reasonable workaround.\n\nLike I mentioned to Ian, if you want to be paranoid, you can also just do +\u003d10, it doesn\u0027t really hurt anyone!",
