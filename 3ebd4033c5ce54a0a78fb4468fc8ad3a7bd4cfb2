      "message": "Thanks Quyen for looking into this. I think this is likely not the best fix since as you have found the other backends (D3D11, Vulkan) are affected too. It seems likely that something\u0027s wrong in the validation - GL_LINES_ADJACENCY was introduced in GLES 3.2 and WebGL doesn\u0027t support that feature level.\n\nI\u0027m looking into this now so it\u0027s OK if you don\u0027t pursue this further.",
