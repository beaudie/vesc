      "message": "I\u0027m not familiar with Angle at all. But, would it be a case to use the PlatformMethod postTask API?\n\nAs far as I get, outside of chrome it will have a std::async(...) call.\nThat said, it may have the restriction on the amount of threads.\n\nWithin chromium code base, this will use worker thread pool.\n\nAlso, I would like to see a trace event on these tasks (when possible).\nA thread without a trace event is not visible at all in chrome://tracing and this is making it really hard to know what is happening in case of jank/hangs or slow startup.\n\nWDYT?",
