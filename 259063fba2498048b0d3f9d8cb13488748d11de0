      "message": "This is a CL to gather thoughts on how to support GL_EXT_texture_buffer to fix app-compat problems.   In particular, \"Special Forces Group 2\" crashes without it.\n\nIt\u0027s obviously non-conformant, but dEQP doesn\u0027t seem to care too much.   I also wonder if this is worth trying to get a spec update/exemption for if there really aren\u0027t any drivers that support those formats anyway.\n\nAnother option is to make app-specific exceptions by looking at the package name, but I would prefer this approach of just enabling it for everyone and fixing issues that come up (if they ever do).",
