You can special case eglQueryContext like before.\n- Remove WaitFor and the platform-specific spin times. Just sleep; there is no amount of hacks like that which could make a non-realtime system work like realtime.\n\nI suggest keeping the sleep at 100us as before, which is just as wrong as 2500us. We don\u0027t have any protection right now, and whatever works in practice is fine until we find a solution.",
