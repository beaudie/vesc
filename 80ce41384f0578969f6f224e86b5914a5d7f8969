      "message": "This mutation of the TStructure\u0027s name does not look good to me. There must be a reason mName is const; perhaps it\u0027s because these objects are stored in hash tables, and mutating the name would prevent them from being looked up again later. Please find a different solution that doesn\u0027t involve breaking the invariants of this class.",
