      "message": "This creates a situation that low level code call into higher level code which will end up call finishImpl, which does lots of things. The worry here is that if finishImpl end up getting into this function (which right now I don\u0027t think it will, but a risk), you may end up with a hang.\n\nI would personally feel more comfortable to deal with this in higher code, like BufferHelper/ImageHelper at least.",

      "message": "It should go even higher; the `vk::` stuff are a layer beneath `rx::`, such as `rx::ContextVk`. Calling back into `ContextVk` to do work from the layer underneath is a layering violation. Unfortunately we haven\u0027t done a good job of making the two layers in the Vulkan backend distinguished.\n\nSo, if you really want to do this, it should be at the `rx::` level that OOM is detected, context is finished, and the operation retried.\n\nThat said, perhaps there\u0027s another way to achieve the memory savings coming from this change. That\u0027s assuming this is even a real problem for applications. Similar to how we flush the command buffer if there\u0027s too much data copy staged, why not proactively flush the context when a significant amount of garbage is accumulated? Then you won\u0027t get to OOM in the first place, and the application wouldn\u0027t have to hitch when that happens. That also works better for multi-context cases, where the context hitting OOM is not necessarily the one holding on to the garbage.",
