      "message": "The test was added to verify that reading from default FBO on a surface created with `default egl config` works properly: this maps to when running deqp tests without specifying the `--deqp-gl-config-name`.\n\nI think it would be clearer if I explicitly list the EGL config here, so that it is easy to see the egl config picked is the default egl config.",

Besides, the default config may not end up being the problematic one, so it\u0027ll rely on luck.\n\nMy suggestion is to use the usual way of selecting the config (`setConfigRedBits`, etc), and specifically target the config that we saw the issue with.",
