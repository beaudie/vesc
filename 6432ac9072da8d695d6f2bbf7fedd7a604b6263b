      "message": "The related Metal feature is `has_shader_stencil_output` that does require MSL 2.1. FWIW, it is always disabled on Intel, meaning that another path is used there.\n\n- Which platforms are known to fail stencil blits with MSL 2.0?\n- Are there other tests that fail with MSL 2.0 but pass with MSL 2.1?\n- Could it be that precompiled MSL 2.0 shaders are somehow used with MSL 2.1 codepath?",
