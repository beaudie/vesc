      "message": "It\u0027s not really what I had in mind. I think we should make this clear and specific for all Intel driver versions. Make a new class IntelDriverVersion, which has two constructors, one with const Optional\u003cLARGE_INTEGER\u003e \u0026 and one with const char *, which takes a string version (\"123.456.89.76\"). Also define operator\u003d\u003d, operator!\u003d, and \u003c, \u003e, \u003c\u003d and \u003e\u003d. Internally you can parse the string into four parts, and the same for LARGE_INTEGER.\n\nHopefully we could re-use the same structure on Linux with a new constructor.",
