      "message": "Small preference: I\u0027d keep this as is, and an if in onImageStateChange(). It\u0027s more clear to me that onImageStateChange is unconditionally called here (since the state definitely changed), and whether that\u0027s a no-op if !texture is a detail onImageStateChange itself needs to worry about.\n\nFor example, it could make sense to move `mDirtyBits.set(DIRTY_BIT_IMAGE_BINDINGS);` to onImageStateChange at some point, which would need to be called regardless.",

      "message": "I started with that but when I look at how assert is used elsewhere, it means that condition must not happen, you shouldn\u0027t be calling here if that\u0027s true. So, if the caller should know that and, in this case, it\u0027s already testing for that condition, change the caller to call this function correctly.\nI\u0027m not sure I have a preference.",
