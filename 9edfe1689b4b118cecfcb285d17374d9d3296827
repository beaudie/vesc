It\u0027s more clear to me that onImageStateChange is unconditionally called here (since the state definitely changed), and whether that\u0027s a no-op if !texture is a detail onImageStateChange itself needs to worry about.\n\nFor example, it could make sense to move `mDirtyBits.set(DIRTY_BIT_IMAGE_BINDINGS);` to onImageStateChange at some point, which would need to be called regardless.",
