      "message": "If someone issues a glFlush, which calls flushCommandBuffer(mtl::NoWait), and then calls eglWaitUntilWorkScheduledANGLE - it seems that the command buffer won\u0027t be ready, and it won\u0027t do the needed wait. Do you think this is something that should be fixed?\n\nIf so - I think we should add a TODO describing the scenario, land this, and iterate on it. This is already a great step forward.\n\nTo address the TODO I think we\u0027d need a dirty bit to know whether we\u0027ve completed a flushCommandBuffer with WaitUntilScheduled against each context. If not, we might need to forcibly allocate an empty one and commit it with waitUntilScheduled. Do you think that\u0027d work?",
