Otherwise you get filenames like:\n```\nappname_context_001.cpp\nappname_context_002.cpp\nappname_context_003.cpp\n```\nand function names like:\n```\nvoid ReplayContextFrame1(void)\n{\n    ReplayContextFrame1Part1();\n    ReplayContextFrame1Part2();\n    ReplayContextFrame1Part3();\n}\n```\n\nActually, there are several files that might need to be renamed so it is easier to find them.  I\u0027ll share a new trace with you that uses ~6 contexts.",
