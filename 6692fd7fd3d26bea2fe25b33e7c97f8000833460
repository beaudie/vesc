      "message": "Then it sounds like this piece of code should live in the capture tool. You could test this entirely from the GL side; create a GL buffer, map it and see if you can mprotect it. It should amount to the same thing, don\u0027t you think?",

      "message": "Thanks for the recommendation. I was able to pull this off using ANGLE\u0027s internal API, doing calls on `Context` directly, in favor of using GL calls in `FrameCapture`. I also ran into issues using GL calls directly like not having extensions available and the uncertainty if this code runs on a native driver (which it must not).\nThis test is now part of the patch on FrameCapture.",
