      "message": "It wasn\u0027t a ton of work to get this working, but figured it may be useful to people, especially as we start shifting to looking at ANGLE\u0027s memory consumption.   \n\nI took a shot that RendererVk::queueSubmit() is the most interesting time to output this data, but let me know if there\u0027s somewhere better.\n\nI didn\u0027t go the full \u0027write to a file\u0027 version, since that seems to get complicated quickly on the various platforms like Android.   I\u0027m open to going that route if there\u0027s a good example that works relatively easily if you guys think that would be better.",
