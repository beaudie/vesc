      "message": "Yes - if the code can\u0027t make sure that the expression is correct, it generates an error. We could make an alternative where we gather the deepest nodes of the traversal into a list and traverse them separately etc., but I don\u0027t think there are any practical uses for a global variable initializer that\u0027s that complex, and in WebGL\u0027s case it would fail the max depth check later either way, so we might just as well not implement that.",
