      "message": "This might seem like a quick fix, but I think we should at least figure out why range is 0. Is the application binding a zero range? In that case we shouldn\u0027t output any xfb output. Or is ANGLE \"forgetting\" the range the application set? In that case we should fix that bug.\n\nDo you think you can trace this and see where this gl::OffsetBindingPointer is set, and how/if it\u0027s changed after the application call? Once we have the data, I\u0027m hoping it would be clear what\u0027s going wrong.",
