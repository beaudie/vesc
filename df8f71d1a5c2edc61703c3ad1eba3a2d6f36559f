      "message": "We used to have dynamic scissor, but there were performance issues on some drivers (QC I guess?). I was thinking it might be a good idea to have a threshold and switch to dynamic scissor if scissor is the only reason for pipeline recreation, but perhaps in practice that\u0027s rare.\n\nFeel free to bring it up anytime.\n\nSorry, I haven\u0027t tested with prerotation. It\u0027s using the same scissor that was otherwise given to the pipeline, so (fingers crossed) it should be fine. Do let me know if you notice issues.",

      "message": "The issue with always-dynamic-scissor was that we were generating a lot of overhead from a bunch of vkCmdBindScissor calls. Now that we are using way fewer command buffers than the original command graph we could probably go back to using always-dynamic-scissor and saving some space in our pipeline desc. OTOH maybe baked scissor is good for some uses cases, so it might be good to keep both around.",
