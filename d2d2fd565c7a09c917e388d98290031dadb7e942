      "message": "Hi Jamie,Shahbaz.\nThis patch is releated to the issue https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/159995959.\n\"srcImageCoords\" needs to be aligned before being used in TEXEL_FETCH.\n\nFor example,in cts dEQP-GLES3.functional.fbo.invalidate.whole.unbind_blit_msaa_color. The input coordinates gl_GlobalInvocationID.x changes from 0 to 31, gl_GlobalInvocationID.y changes from 0 to 127. We can get the sample position srcImageCoords:(128-y,128-4x) after calculation for flipping and rotation. So the sample position srcImageCoords.x (128-y) changes between [1,128], srcImageCoords.y (128-4x) changes between [4,128] (after adding xDir).",

      "message": "I took a look and here\u0027s what I see:\n\n- If blitting, the coordinates are vec2 and texture() is used to read from src\n- If resolving, the coordinates are ivec2 and texelFetch() is used to read from src\n\n---\n\nWith blit, I agree there\u0027s a difference between BlitResolve.frag and BlitResolveStencilNoExport.comp and that must be a bug. In the FS, the coordinates are NNN.5 but in the CS they would be NNN. With the point sampler that might be fine, but definitely an issue with the linear sampler (if that even makes sense for a stencil image?)\n\nThe solution is probably a simple param-\u003eoffset.xy -\u003d 0.5 (on the CPU) if blitting (and not resolving), or maybe +\u003d 0.5 if flipped. If you are interested in fixing this, a regression test to verify the change against would be a necessary first step.\n\n---\n\nWith resolve, I don\u0027t see a difference. The FS coordinates are 0.5 higher yes, but cast to ivec2 they should produce the same values.\n\nSee the comment in BlitResolve.frag. When flipped, the source coordinates correspond to the opposite side of the blit rectangle. When resolving, these are integer coordinates and AdjustBlitResolveParametersForResolve should have made sure they are -1ed. I still don\u0027t understand why there\u0027s a different between the FS and CS shaders in this regard.\n\nIt\u0027s possible that AdjustBlitResolveParametersForResolve is not doing the right thing. Maybe params-\u003eoffset needs to be modified based on flip too (which would have the same effect as the change in this CL), but that would affect the FS and CS similarly.\n\n---\n\nTo better understand/debug the issue, could you please write a few tests that reproduce the bug (with the +\u003d 2 hack removed) and don\u0027t rely on prerotation to fail? It might be possible that we already have tests that are affected by this, but the test is using a uniform value for stencil, masking the problem. It would be ok to modify those tests to have unique stencil values per pixel.",

      "message": "Thanks Shahbaz. We finished the office moving and started working on this CL again. \n\nSome test results to update:\n1）AdjustBlitResolveParametersForResolve\ndEQP-GLES3.functional.fbo.invalidate.whole.unbind_blit_msaa_color.\nOn Linux, AdjustBlitResolveParametersForResolve funcition can work because multisample stencil buffer is blitted to default framebuffer. So destFramebufferRotation is true, and filpY is enabled. The shaderParams.offset decreases from 300 to 299 and srcImageCoords.y in shader could be (127-gl_GlobalInvocationID.y).\nOn android, EarlyAdjustFlipYForPreRotation function will disable destFramebufferRotation. In AdjustBlitResolveParametersForResolve function, the four xxx.isReversedY() conditions are all false.\nSo I think AdjustBlitResolveParametersForResolve may only handle the filp operation in Linux but can\u0027t deal with prerotation correctly.\n\n2) added test\nAs mentioned in 1), it\u0027s wrong to add \"-1\" in compute shader, for linux, it would become (126-gl_GlobalInvocationID.y). There wasn\u0027t end2end to cover it and the CTS tests could accept mismatch in two rows, so the dry run passed. If you test the added end2end in patchset 2, you can get failures when y\u003d0.\nExpected equality of these values:\n  GLColor::blue\n    Which is: Blue\n  angle::ReadColor(0, 0)\n    Which is: Green\n......\nSo, maybe it\u0027s better to add -1/0.5 in CPU and change the offset in prerotaion path.\nIf needed, I\u0027ll add more end2end tests later.\n\n3)msaa\nOn Linux,msaa0 will enable canBlitWithCommand.\nI\u0027ll get more information on android tomorrow.",
