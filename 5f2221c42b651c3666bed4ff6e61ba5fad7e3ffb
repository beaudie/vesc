A function named \"checkSomething\" should not clear something as a side effect, its not intuitive from the user\u0027s perspective calling it that a state will change because something is being checked.\n\nI\u0027ll give the +1 to the review but I think you should find a better name for it that will be more indicative of what it does when its called.",
