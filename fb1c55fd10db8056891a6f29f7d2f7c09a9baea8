Unfortunately we don\u0027t have any device in CQ, so it\u0027s prone to breakage. \n\nIt seems like they have some CI which is using ANGLE, so we should at least find out eventually, just not before we land the CL that broke it.   However, since developers don\u0027t have Fuchsia devices, they wouldn\u0027t be able to fix it either, so I\u0027m not sure what our answer for that is anyway.\n\n\u003e Also, I\u0027d really like to rip out the emulation code\n\nI can\u0027t find anything on VK_EXT_multisampled_render_to_single_sampled - is that meant to implement all of the MSRTT stuff like unresolving with multiple subpasses and eveerything so ANGLE doesn\u0027t have to?   If so, is it going to be part of the mobile vulkan profile so we can push other GPU vendors to implement it also?\n\n\u003e Chromium on Vulkan on Android: do we need to worry about this?\n\nNot yet, but our goal is to support it someday as part of being the default OpenGL ES driver in Android.   Of course, no idea if/when that will occur.",
