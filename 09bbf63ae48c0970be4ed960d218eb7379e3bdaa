It logs one logcat message every time the callback is called.  For each Vulkan object type, it keeps track of how much GPU memory has been allocated and imported.\n\nI have found I can do some memory analysis by turning on API command logging via:\n\n  angle_enable_trace \u003d true\n  angle_enable_trace_android_logcat \u003d true\n",
