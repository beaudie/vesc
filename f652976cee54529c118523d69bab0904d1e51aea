I think we should decide as a team we are ready for this and make sure the various stakeholders are aware, since this is a fairly large change.   It appears to have several benefits, so I\u0027d like to land it, but I don\u0027t want to rush it either.\n\nI know you\u0027ve asking Cody to give this a shot to see how it impacts performance of the traces - is there anyone else that we think has an opinion or additional testing we can try before flipping the switch (CuttleFish, Fuschia, Chrome, etc.)?\n\nIt\u0027s also a lot more work to switch than I realized.   What will reverting this look like if we do hit a blocking bug?   With how many files this is hitting, unwinding it will likely become difficult/impossible fairly quickly.",
