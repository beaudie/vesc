Assuming the previous comment is fixed to use the real device id, you\u0027re going to end up picking the first adapter in the list with a match. Device and vendor ids are not unique on the system. \n\nIf you\u0027re going to use this CL to do power preference, a better approach would be to use EnumAdapterByGpuPreference instead of EnumAdapters.",
