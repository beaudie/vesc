Assuming the previous comment is fixed to use the real device id, you\u0027re going to end up picking the first adapter in the list with a match.

I agree the change is functionally correct.\n\nReading through the extension document, would be nice if it had examples of how \"device id\" gets mapped to the platform specific counterparts. Had I not known any better, I would have still gotten the impression it was talking about PCI device id.\n\nPerhaps a better name might be \"adapter_unique_id\" or something similar??",
