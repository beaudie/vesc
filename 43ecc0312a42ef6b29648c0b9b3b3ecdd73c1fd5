My suggestion is to keep this here with an `ifdef ANGLE_DUMP_PIPELINE_CACHE_GRAPH` around it like in ContextVk.cpp, then check for `kDumpPipelineCacheGraph \u0026\u0026 contextVk-\u003eisPipelineCacheGraphDumpEnabled()` below (or use a helper). That will help the compiler DCE the functions when the functionality is not built at all.",
