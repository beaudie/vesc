I don\u0027t think Firefox has seen any issues here, so I\u0027m very curious what\u0027s going on for you. \u003clocale\u003e even predates c++11, so it really really should work. If you don\u0027t have a solution for it, I\u0027m game to add a configurable define, but I don\u0027t want to bake the platform logic inline. Absent crashes on our side, I would like to do the standard method.\n\nIt\u0027s also not exactly attractive to replace the correct approach with a likely-buggy approach that causes mysterious rendering issues.",
