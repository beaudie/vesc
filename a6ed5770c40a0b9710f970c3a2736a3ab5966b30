      "message": "I\u0027d rather not have isAnyValueSet() and isDeclared() separately here, even though the isDeclared check is faster. It\u0027s a bit weird that sometimes objects of is class fill the isLocalSizeValid() invariant and sometimes not - it might be simpler to just assume everywhere that it is not necessarily true.",
