      "message": "In the last patch, there were failures due to the `BindingsBenchmark` perf test. It was originally using a type index with the host-visible bit. However, after this change, it tried allocating from an index with the protected bit, although it was not required. which led to VVL errors. I added an update to ignore that bit if it is not required. The test is now using the device-local-only type index.",
