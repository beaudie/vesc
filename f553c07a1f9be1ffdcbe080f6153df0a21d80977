      "message": "There are two ways we can interpret this.\n\nA) INVALID_OPERATION is returned for the explicitly specified cases. For other cases which are not valid, no behavior is specified, therefore it is undefined, and INVALID_OPERATION or INVALID_ENUM are both valid.\n\nB) INVALID_OPERATION is returned for the explicitly specified cases. In other cases, the blanket specification for INVALID_ENUM in 2.5 \"GL Errors\" applies:\n\n\"If a command that requires an enumerated value is passed a symbolic constant that is not one of those specified as allowable for that command, the error INVALID_ENUM is generated.\"\n\nIn that case, I would say that there\u0027s room to interpret it as applying even to the default framebuffer, despite the loose language about \"...a constant other than...\"",
