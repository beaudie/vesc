      "message": "As an aside, I notice we are inconsistent about the version of fxc.exe being used:\n\n git grep \u0027HLSL Shader Compiler\u0027 | awk \u0027{ print $NF }\u0027 | sort | uniq -c\n      10 6.3.9600.16384\n     178 9.29.952.3111\n\nPresumably that\u0027s because only deliberately modified shaders get committed/submitted after someone runs the generate_shaders.bat script, but it\u0027d be nice to make them consistent. Perhaps at the same time, consider using an fxc.exe from a recent Windows 10 SDK instead of the Windows 8.1 SDK currently being used. (I actually had to go *find* a Windows 8.1 SDK installer in order to get mine to match what generate_shaders.bat was expecting to use.)",

I\u0027d just use whatever is latest. Feel free to recompile all the shaders (in a separate change) to make that consistent if you care about that.",
