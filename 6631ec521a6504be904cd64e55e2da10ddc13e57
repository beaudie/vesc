Perhaps at the same time, consider using an fxc.exe from a recent Windows 10 SDK instead of the Windows 8.1 SDK currently being used. (I actually had to go *find* a Windows 8.1 SDK installer in order to get mine to match what generate_shaders.bat was expecting to use.)",

The error says:\n\n\u003e The input stage requires Semantic/Index (TEXCORD,0) as input, but it is not provided by the output stage\n\nWhich basically means that the fragment shader is not getting valid values for its varying. The only way I could see this working is if the whole texture has a uniform color, so no matter what the coordinates are the fragment shader invocations end up reading the same value. Unfortunately our end2end tests do frequently produce uniformly colored images.\n\nEither that, or d3d is magically fixing this error under the hood.\n\nI have one suggestion for a regression test, and if that still magically works, I\u0027d say nevermind it. The suggestion is to find a test where this error triggers, then duplicate/modify it such that the texture being sampled here (which is the source of resolve I presume) was originally rendered to with `essl1_shaders::fs::Checkered()`.",
