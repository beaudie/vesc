      "message": "Thanks for adding support for comments. Result looks great!\n\nI know it\u0027s a hack but how about moving the comment inside this dict, something like\n```\n\u0027__android_bp_comment\u0027: \u0027comment\u0027,\n```\nand handle it as a special case in write_blueprint. Then you can drop the comment about the tuple below and the `*rest` stuff. There might be a cleaner way to do this as well, but it might end up touching a lot of the file which is more work (and should be a separate CL)",
