      "message": "Ideally we wouldn\u0027t expose GL_EXT_multisampled_render_to_texture unless VK_EXT_depth_stencil_resolve is supported. However, as that extension is rather new and our drivers are old, we would lose precious testing and non-depth-stencil tests.\n\nAdditionally, ideally the application renders in such a way that depth/stencil resolve doesn\u0027t happen (through invalidate calls), so gating this useful GL extension on support for a rarely-used VK extension seems like a pity. I\u0027m in the process of making sure chromium always does the right thing and never needs that extension.",
