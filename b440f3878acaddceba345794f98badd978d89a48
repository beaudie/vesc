      "message": "@shahbaz, observation:\n\nI stepped through all the code and I find one odd thing, in the RendererVk there is mPendingOneOffCommands which collects the OneOff ComamndBuffers - and it is collecting the 2 I create, but they should be flushed?, one after LockSurface and one after UnlockSurface.  I see no code releasing/flushing/poping them off except when RendererVk destroys. So that doesn\u0027t seem right. Is there something to call to cause them to be executed? ",

I figured by the calls to finish or vkDeviceWaitIdle () {which is just a debug tool to be sure flushed} would be finished and the commands in the recycler recycled.\n\nWait for next upload, we are sync\u0027n now. I cleaned up duplicates and other code.\n\nLook at commit #3: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/3174323\nAnd specifically look at SurfaceVk and vk_helpers where I do a OneOffCommand to copy Image-Buffer. Anything missing? I checked every other use of OneOffCommands and included the same elements - getCommandBufferOneOff, add Image Barrier for layout, call copy, queueSubmitOneOff, finishToSerial. Looks like it should work.\n\nMy test dies:\nglClear to Green\nlockSurface\nget bitmap pointer (the buffer is always black)\nfill buffer with red\nunlockSurface (which should write red back.)\nglReadPixels (says surface is still green instead of red)",
