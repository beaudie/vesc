      "message": "@shahbaz, observation:\n\nI stepped through all the code and I find one odd thing, in the RendererVk there is mPendingOneOffCommands which collects the OneOff ComamndBuffers - and it is collecting the 2 I create, but they should be flushed?, one after LockSurface and one after UnlockSurface.  I see no code releasing/flushing/poping them off except when RendererVk destroys. So that doesn\u0027t seem right. Is there something to call to cause them to be executed? ",
