      "message": "I spent a lots of efforts to find the crash reason - an invalid pointer. The crash stack only showed that the member of LinkedUniform was incorrectly written. And the crash point was random. So I added many print sentences to narrow down the searching scope. Finally, I found that executing \u0027mAttribsToTranslate.set()\u0027 could cause the member of LinkedUniform rewritten. However, it\u0027s still weird for me that ::set can cause it. So I added the ASSERT and found that mBits was already an invalid value. And this ASSERT made the cash 100% reproducible. And that\u0027s why I found mVertexArray11 was invalid to compute shader. So I think it\u0027s very useful to add these ASSERTs.",
