      "message": "IIRC the reason for batching based on parameterized test name was so that we don\u0027t set-up/tear-down D3D, then GL, then Vulkan, etc for each test.\n\nDoes that mean that we skip that optimization for whatever the set of tests without \"ES\" in the name? Do we run those tests on multiple backends? How many are there? Does this make a measurable difference?",

I double-checked on Linux and Windows and verified all our end2end_tests begin with \"ES\". It is a bit hacky and if someone has a better idea can address it in a follow-up.",
