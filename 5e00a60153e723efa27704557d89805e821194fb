      "message": "This is interesting.\n\nThe spec is pretty clear that an active transform feedback must be associated with a single program.\n\nI think in this case you should use a BindingPointer to link the Program to the TransformFeedback when the XFB is active. That keeps the state contained to the GL object, which we have from the ID in any case.\n\nThen the hasActiveTransformFeedback operation could be completed by iterating the list of TransformFeedback objects in the Context. This is slower, but because it\u0027s only called during LinkProgram and ProgramBinary operations, this is an acceptable cost. This will let you remove the std::set, and the add and remove methods.\n\nThere\u0027s also the question of what happens if the call DeleteProgram on a program that\u0027s associated with an active transform feedback - how do we handle that?",

      "message": "I\u0027ll change this so that the program association is stored in the transform feedback object instead.\n\nThe GLES 3.0 spec says about DeleteProgram that \"If program is not the current program for any GL context, it is deleted immediately.\" It doesn\u0027t seem to matter whether it is associated with an active transform feedback. Possibly you could still call EndTransformFeedback in this case and everything would be fine. EndTransformFeedback performs an implicit ResumeTransformFeedback, but at least dEQP doesn\u0027t expect EndTransformFeedback on a paused transform feedback to trigger all the errors that ResumeTransformFeedback would trigger. This is a matter of interpretation, so maybe it warrants more discussion.",

I\u0027m not sure what the null ValidProgram represents, but that check would either be removed, moved to the validator, or made to no-op in the Context method.",

      "message": "What about cases where both the validation and the implementation need to look up the same object, isn\u0027t it better to avoid duplicating the lookup between the validation and the implementation? That could cause slowness that might not be caught by small perf tests that only deal with a very small number of objects.\n\nWould it be the best if I change functions to follow the new pattern also in the follow-up patch sets, which have very minor changes to existing validation in some of the entry point functions?",
