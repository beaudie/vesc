Does anyone see I am doing incorrectly here, is there other limits that I should check against?\n\nAlso FYI as unrelated comment, I am going to remove VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT here in next update. I dont think we need it for uniform buffers.",

      "message": "This may be an interaction with limits.minUniformBufferOffsetAlignment and limits.maxUniformBufferRange where you\u0027re requesting the maximum buffer size but the alignment is modifying the size of the allocation to correct the offset.   I don\u0027t actually know the details of how that all works and interacts, but I\u0027ve seen allocators do weird things before.   Once thing to try is \u0027maxUniformBufferRange - someWiggleRoom\u0027 to handle alignment requirements.\n\nCould always be a QC driver bug too though, which I wouldn\u0027t expect a fix for on Pixel 2 (let alone on our bots), so either way it likely requires a Pixel 2 workaround.",

      "message": "The 64K buffer size should be able to accommodate any alignment requirement, so I am not sure if alignment is an issue. I just think not much value to debug a pixel2 specific failure given that pixel4 passes the test on my local run. I will try to adjust the size in separate CL so that it is easier to track in case of regression.",
