      "message": "Rather than insert android into these names, maybe we can move them to an `android` sub dir?  In the final Android.bp, it is easy to see this pattern:\n```\nangle_codegen {\n    name: \"libGLESv2_angle_codegen\",\n``` \nwhere the name just has the target prepended to the module.\n\nMaybe we just have to stick android in everywhere? like:\n```\nangle_android_codegen {\n    name: \"libGLESv2_angle_android_codegen\",\n```\nalthough that\u0027s a little crowded.\n\nOr maybe there is a way to have the name of the file differ from the package itself?  I didn\u0027t try that.",
