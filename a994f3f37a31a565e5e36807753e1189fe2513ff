      "message": "Rather than insert android into these names, maybe we can move them to an `android` sub dir?  In the final Android.bp, it is easy to see this pattern:\n```\nangle_codegen {\n    name: \"libGLESv2_angle_codegen\",\n``` \nwhere the name just has the target prepended to the module.\n\nMaybe we just have to stick android in everywhere? like:\n```\nangle_android_codegen {\n    name: \"libGLESv2_angle_android_codegen\",\n```\nalthough that\u0027s a little crowded.\n\nOr maybe there is a way to have the name of the file differ from the package itself?  I didn\u0027t try that.",

      "message": "I like having a common id like `angle_android_codegen`, makes it easy to find related places in codesearch. We can move things around later if we find a better way to structure it.\n\nI like your second suggestion. Changed to `_angle_android_codegen` by appending `_android_codegen`, `_angle` is added by `angle_libs_suffix`:\nhttps://crsrc.org/c/third_party/angle/gni/angle.gni;drc\u003d3960e63b1a9ce85658a9031c43d55efd85534525;l\u003d132",
