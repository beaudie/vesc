      "message": "I end up flushing the deferred glFlsuh at the boundary of Draw FBO switch. Otherwise I am seeing perf regression on TRex and Manhattan. Without a more sophsicated GPU progress checking and proactively do implicit submission as soon as we see GOU runs low on work, I think this is the right balance to fix the manhattan\u0027s in-FBO glFlush without triggering offline perf regression. This essentially limit the glFlush noop for the glFlush calls that are called within the same draw FBO. ",

      "message": "Regarding 1-4: For Manhattan it is just 1. 4 is sort of my guess number, there is no real data behind it. This means within *one* FBO rendering if you call glFlush 4 times, we are going to submit it. I can make it a lot bigger (like 1024 or even no limit). But I think I will feel more comfortable right now to still flush it more often than less often. Once we have finer grain GPU execution in the command buffer, then we can take that into consideration as well. But as of now, I think whatever number we pick it is going to be guesstimate.\n\nRegarding draw FBO with frame boundaries: At least for now, we have to detect the frame boundary in order to not introduce regression. drawFBO switch is the trick I am using right now for detecting frame boundary. As I said, I think the longer term is to have better visibility into GPU execution and based on that instead of frame boundary. But I also have some feeling that even with that, we might still need to detect frame boundary to do flush in order to not regression perf. We can ask ARM/IMG in next meeting how they balance this. It is tricky thing to do anyway.\n\nThe current approach I am making here is more conservative one, that I basically only targeting glFlush calls that would other wise break renderpass that could have been avoided with this CL.",

When there\u0027s a flush, don\u0027t try to be clever, and always defer (see next suggestion)\n\n- Flush on endRP instead of FBO change. That\u0027s exactly the purpose of the change (don\u0027t break RP because of flush), and respects the application\u0027s flush call more precisely. In flushImpl(), instead of deferring up to 4 times, do this: \"if RP started and not empty, defer the flush, otherwise do the flush\".\n\nWith the above suggestions, the change should become simpler too.",

One of the reason I did it this way is that I try to do it at top level as I can to have better API layering (prevent lower API cal back to higher level API and form a call loop). Until we have a better idea how to do more sophisticated submission, I like the idea to limited glFlush deferral to renderpass.\n\nI have kept the mDeferredFlushCount instead of a boolean to keep a bit more information for debugging/informational purpose. But I have removed mDeferredFlushAllowed since sync objects won\u0027t get inserted in the middle of renderpass, so that is the plus side of flush at endRP time.",
