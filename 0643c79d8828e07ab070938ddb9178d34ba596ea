      "message": "I end up flushing the deferred glFlsuh at the boundary of Draw FBO switch. Otherwise I am seeing perf regression on TRex and Manhattan. Without a more sophsicated GPU progress checking and proactively do implicit submission as soon as we see GOU runs low on work, I think this is the right balance to fix the manhattan\u0027s in-FBO glFlush without triggering offline perf regression. This essentially limit the glFlush noop for the glFlush calls that are called within the same draw FBO. ",
