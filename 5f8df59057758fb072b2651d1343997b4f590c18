      "message": "I did some testing on Pixel 4 XL.  With the NBA 2K20 perftest, I did not see any gain (perhaps some, but well within the noise).  However, with AGI analysis of the actual game, I saw that no frames blocked on ANI/dequeue_buffer, and that the ANI calls occured shortly before the QP calls.  It was as I expected.  When combined with multiple threads, the hope is that we will see CPU-time improvement.",
