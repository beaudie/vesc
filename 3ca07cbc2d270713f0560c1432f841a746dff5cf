      "message": "Looking at `HasFullBufferFormatSupport`, we look for `VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_VERTEX_BUFFER_BIT` in these formats. I see from the spec that `VK_FORMAT_A2B10G10R10_UINT_PACK32` doesn\u0027t have mandatory support for this feature. If a driver doesn\u0027t support it, we don\u0027t have a fallback. `VK_FORMAT_R16G16B16A16_UINT` does have mandatory support (which is why the fallback was as it was originally). See Table 68 here: https://renderdoc.org/vkspec_chunked/chap43.html#features-required-format-support\n\nIn the very least, this should be turned into a list:\n\n     \"buffer\": [ \"R10G10B10A2_UINT\", \"R16G16B16A16_FLOAT\" ]\n     \nSimilarly with the other formats, based on which have mandatory support.",

      "message": "Looking at ConvertVertex.comp, it seems that I never implemented swizzling of components. It\u0027s probably a simple case of handling RGB10A2 vs A2RGB10, and wouldn\u0027t need a more generic and complex solution. Let me know if you have trouble with that.",
