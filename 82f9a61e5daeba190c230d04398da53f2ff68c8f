If Vulkan behaves differently from GL, and the GL behavior is in spec, then the Vulkan backend should fix the output to match GL\u0027s. If it\u0027s undefined in GL then the test should be relaxed based on what part is undefined in GL rather than what Vulkan does specifically.",

      "message": "From this sentence it looks like this is entirely a precision issue, rather than anything related to \"unused byte\". Isn\u0027t the depth readback supposed to take the 24-bit unorm value from the depth buffer and scale it to 32-bit unorm? How does the unused byte come into play?",
