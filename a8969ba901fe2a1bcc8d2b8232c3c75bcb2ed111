      "message": "This worked for the previous use cases, as each binding was kept until just before it was reallocated.  In `UtilsVk`, the sets are immediately freed, so the binding is `!isReferenced()`. So, it\u0027s very much a possibility that the same set as before is no longer in use and can be reused. I didn\u0027t notice any issues with reusing the same pool.",
