      "message": "I took a cursory glance, and this is the part I don\u0027t like. Basically ProgramExecutable is permanently keeping a duplicate of the linked state, am I right?\n\nThat\u0027s just wasted memory. So instead of:\n\n    clearState();\n    linkIntoState();\n    if (success)\n        saveState();\n\nI suggest this:\n\n    linkIntoTemp();\n    if (success)\n        clearState();\n        moveTempIntoState();\n\nWhich means the same amount of memory is used as before, except it\u0027s doubled during link only. At the same time, the end result is a \"move\" from the temp to state instead of \"copy\".\n\n(It\u0027s possible I misunderstood something, I didn\u0027t look too deeply)",
