      "message": "I took a cursory glance, and this is the part I don\u0027t like. Basically ProgramExecutable is permanently keeping a duplicate of the linked state, am I right?\n\nThat\u0027s just wasted memory. So instead of:\n\n    clearState();\n    linkIntoState();\n    if (success)\n        saveState();\n\nI suggest this:\n\n    linkIntoTemp();\n    if (success)\n        clearState();\n        moveTempIntoState();\n\nWhich means the same amount of memory is used as before, except it\u0027s doubled during link only. At the same time, the end result is a \"move\" from the temp to state instead of \"copy\".\n\n(It\u0027s possible I misunderstood something, I didn\u0027t look too deeply)",

      "message": "With the latest change, rather than the full ShaderState being saved, it\u0027s just the vectors of input and output varyings for each stage (along with versions), so I think this should be a minimal impact - especially with the addition of only doing it for separable programs.\n\nDoes that work for you Shabi?",

      "message": "@Jamie, it\u0027s not about saving memory during link. Current implementation increases memory footprint by saving duplicate information permanently. My suggestion is in fact to increase memory usage during link, to avoid having to increase it afterwards.\n\n@Tim, it\u0027s better, sure, but it\u0027s still a waste. ShaderVar is not exactly a small struct. But if it\u0027s too much work to fix it, I\u0027m not blocking the change!",
