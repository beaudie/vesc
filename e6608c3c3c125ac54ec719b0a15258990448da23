      "message": "Perhaps I\u0027m missing something, but I think we don\u0027t want this line as long as we have the for-loop above it OR we want to change the for-loop to not destroy oldSwapchain (my currently-preferred solution).\n\nThe idea is that the for-loop will destroy oldSwapchain, but then its handle is being kept around (both here, and it\u0027s given to vkCreateSwapchainKHR().  I think that could cause a crash if we came back here quickly enough that the above-for-loop tries to destroy this swapchain again.  Is my logic correct?",
