      "message": "This can\u0027t be done, since we have to add the current group to the top of the stack after the pop, and if the relevant data would really be destroyed, then valgrind should report access to freed memory, but it doesn\u0027t, at least not in the case of group. \n\nThe std::move should steal the content of the value on top, so that the pop() afterwards removes an empty object. However, for some reason there seems to be a problem with std::string here, because with the un-patched version valgrind reports the use of un-initialized memory in the destructor, a \"std::cerr \u003c\u003c name;\" after initializing name clears that error, and so does moving the pop() to after passing it to make_pair.",
