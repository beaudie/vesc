I expect any code that deals with host-visible buffer writes to look like:\n\n```\nif (mComputePassCommands-\u003egetAndResetHasHostVisibleBufferWrite())\n   issue_barriers()\n```\n\nOtherwise it\u0027s really hard to verify there is no functionality bug. Where were these barriers are supposed be added already?",
