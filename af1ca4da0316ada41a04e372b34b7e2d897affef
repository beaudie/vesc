      "message": "This is the old fix version. New version: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/4296014\n\n\u003e Is the bug you try to fix hitting any real usage?\n\nYes. Very long time ago there was crash in some app. My colleague fixed by simply finalizing layout. This fix was enough. I do not remember what app it was. We simply fix bugs without much bureaucracy.\n\nThen I ported his fix to a new ANGLE version and also added finalize for render buffer.\n\nNow prepared this CL. During this process I found that simply finalizing may corrupt RenderPass state if texture that finalizes not the one that used in the RenderPass.\n\n\u003e My understanding is that EGLImage currently also have another bug (https://issuetracker.google.com/169868803). There are effort to make all contexts references EGLImage to be shared but then reverted, then individual locks added, but not sure if this is completely fixed. If not, we have a bigger problem to deal with as well.\n\nYes. I already mentioned that I have solution with mutexes. Just do not have time to prepare CL for review...\nThis CL not only to fix EGLImage problem but also decouple independent share groups with separate mutex.\n\n\u003e The way I am thinking is to let EGLImage have multiple ImageHelper objects, one per shared group.

I do no know how to implement this or what other problems may appear. Maybe try solution with mutexes first and then optimize if needed?",
