My own preference is something similar to what we had before: `ensureNoPendingSubmission` (previous name `ensureNoPendingWork` was indeed not accurate)\n\nWe could also call `submitCommands` like `scheduleCommandSubmission` but that\u0027s overkill IMO",

      "message": "Also agree with Shabi that \"Actually\" is implied.\n\nWe do have a terminology issue here that \"submit\" has different meaning with CommandProcessor versus CommandQueue. I was thinking to rename CommandProcessor:: submitCommands to CommandProcessor::enqueueCommands (and other CommandProcessor\u0027s public APIs will be similarly renamed). Then this waitForQueueSerialToBeSubmitted  actually makes sense.",
