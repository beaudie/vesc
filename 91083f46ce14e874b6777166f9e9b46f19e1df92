The waitFence here ensures the fence corresponding to that frame\u0027s vkQueueSubmit is signaled. Is the issue that the presentation engine may still not have processed the corresponding semaphore?\n\nIf so, we may have to think about where and when to clean up presentImageSemaphore, but the change in this CL is not the answer.",
