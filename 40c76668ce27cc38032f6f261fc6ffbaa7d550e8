On the other hand, I think it would be really pointless to prefix every method of the validator with \"validate\" or \"check\". I don\u0027t have any really great other ideas, though.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not sure about expressing \"detected no error, and the context is free to render\" as \"ready\". It kind of makes more sense to me for whether-or-not-something-gets-drawn not to be any of the validator\u0027s business at all. Although that would be complicated by the need to go without a context or renderer for a mock setup. Could we create a mock base class for one of those objects, or would that just be making a mess?",
