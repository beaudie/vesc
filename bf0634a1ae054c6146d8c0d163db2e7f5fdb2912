What about std::vector?\n\nIn the past I did experience a FastVector-like implementation being slower, presumable because more-malloc-during-vector-build is faster than adding-if(spilled)-during-vector-access, at least in some scenarios, so I\u0027m not totally surprised. But I\u0027m not sure a list is the best choice.",
