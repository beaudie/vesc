If that\u0027s the case, I believe our expectation is that they will fork ANGLE to add their secret sauce they don\u0027t want to make public and merge into ANGLE.

I mentioned to Cody that I expect there to be additional differences between the Google and AOSP versions of ANGLE, like the rules file that determines where to run it.   We may not want to make any assumptions about devices/GPUs/apps/etc. in the AOSP version so it truly can be run anywhere, but be more restricting in the Google version for stability/performance reasons.   As with my other comment, we can always clean things up in the future if it makes sense or we get more feedback.",
