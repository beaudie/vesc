To properly fill out this field we would need to call vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties for the config format and check VkImageFormatProperties::maxResourceSize. See https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkImageFormatProperties.html . In practice you could try using a threshold and seeing if that works. It\u0027s possible there are no tests that exercise this cap.",
