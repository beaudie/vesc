      "message": "What\u0027s the real motivation for this change? Chromium on Fuchsia runs already. Was Fuchsia faking support for VK_KHR_swapchain and plans to no longer do it?\n\nIs it possible for Fuchsia to implement VK_EXT_headless_surface, and then we can use DisplayVkHeadless?",

      "message": "We do have swapchain on Fuchsia (used in DisplayVkFuchsia), but it\u0027s not being used when running chromium on Fuchsia. We use ImagePipe directly (see https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:components/viz/service/display_embedder/output_presenter_fuchsia.h ).\nCurrently ANGLE depends on swapchain layer. This means that we have to package VkLayer_image_pipe_swapchain.so in web_engine.far. This increases package size (by more than 400kB) and wastes resources in runtime, which is not ideal when running on devices with limited resources (note that in most cases the version that gets packaged in chromium is not the same as the one used in other packages, so it doesn\u0027t get deduped in storage)\n\nWe currently don\u0027t have VK_EXT_headless_surface implementation on Fuchsia. If we had it, it would require packaging a separate .so file. It would probably be a bit smaller than VkLayer_image_pipe_swapchain.so, but this doesn\u0027t look like the best solution. What I\u0027m trying to achieve with this CL is to make ANGLE usable without the Surface/Swapchain extensions.",
