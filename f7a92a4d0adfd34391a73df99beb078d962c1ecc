      "message": "With regards to the overall design, I think the CommandProcessor file should make less effort to segregate protected and unprotected contexts. We should really be handling multiple contexts similarly, the fact that protected ones have a few extra flags set shouldn\u0027t make big changes IMO. The duplicated lists can be consolidated, and submission could submit both command buffers with the protected flag set if !protectedCB.empty(). It\u0027s ok to submit an unprotected CB with a submission flagged as protected.",

      "message": "The spec was not clear to me as when PROTECTED_BIT was required for protected operation, or just mean protected handling was enabled for the structure. Not always clear.\nAnyway, I did have everything divided in CommandQueue, and then started un-duplicating the members.\n\nIt seems then, we just need 2 CommandPools? one protected, one not (if supported). Everything else the PROTECTED_BIT is just an enablement, not a requirement.\n\n\"It\u0027s ok to submit an unprotected CB with a submission flagged as protected.\" Why would this be ok?
