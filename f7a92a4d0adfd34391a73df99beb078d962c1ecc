We should really be handling multiple contexts similarly, the fact that protected ones have a few extra flags set shouldn\u0027t make big changes IMO. The duplicated lists can be consolidated, and submission could submit both command buffers with the protected flag set if !protectedCB.empty(). It\u0027s ok to submit an unprotected CB with a submission flagged as protected.",
