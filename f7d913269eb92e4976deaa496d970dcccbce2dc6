      "message": "The timestamp before and after the draw cannot be the same unless either:\n\n- The draw call took 0 time (which we can safely assume cannot happen)\n- The timestamp resolution is lower than the draw call time\n\nThe latter _may_ be true on some platforms, but I\u0027d much rather make the draw call more expensive instead. With LE, if the timestamps and the draw are reordered due to a bug for example, you won\u0027t catch that.\n\nThe anglebug says this started happening recently, maybe there\u0027s a real regression.",

      "message": "Two draw calls can most definitely have the same timestamp for any number of reasons that the driver can\u0027t identify individual timestamps. e.g. on tilers you only get timestamp resolution for RenderPasses. The Intel driver is likely having the same problem. The driver has no guarantee of resolution \u003d No bug here.",
