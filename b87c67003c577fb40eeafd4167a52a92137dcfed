Given that when you initialized `mColorTextureInitialized` to true in previous patchset, the SurfaceInitialized test failed on try bots. I am not sure that textures\u0027 initial data are always zeros.\n\nI don\u0027t think there is any test testing only stencil buffer in the default framebuffer, hence this path might not have coverage.",
