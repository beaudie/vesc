See here for an example of how we upload to gerrit:\n\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle/+/master/doc/ContributingCode.md#making-changes\n\nIn short, we use `git cl upload` which runs a hook to make sure some basic issues are fixed, such as missing the Bug: tag, bad formatting etc. Indeed, this change needs a `git cl format` to pass the \"presubmit bot\".\n\nOther useful reading material:\n\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle/+/master/README.md#contributing",

      "message": "It\u0027s a bit alarming that libANGLE/Constants.h defines some limits for uniform buffers, but they are not consistently applied as hard limits in libANGLE/Context.cpp (Context::initCaps()), yet every here and there those limits are assumed.\n\nInstead of this change, can you please modify Context::initCaps() to apply these limits in the frontend itself? There\u0027s a line that says:\n\n    LimitCap(\u0026mState.mCaps.maxShaderUniformBlocks[ShaderType::Vertex],\n             IMPLEMENTATION_MAX_VERTEX_SHADER_UNIFORM_BUFFERS);\n\nBasically that line needs to be duplicated to set the limits of Fragment and Compute, and another line added that sets the limit of maxCombinedUniformBlocks. Note that maxUniformBufferBindings is capped right after.",
