      "message": "Few comments about this CL:\n- The relevant changes are actually small, though it is marked as XL commit.\n- The main change in the OpenCL headers is the removal of macro CL_API_ENTRY from the typedefs. Additional changes are only in cl_icd.h (fixed include order which was messed up by clang-format) and in cl_platform.h (preserve CL_API_ENTRY if set).\n- Added \u0027SortIncludes: false\u0027 to .clang-format files to ensure that they really don\u0027t format anything.\n- The remaining changes are quite small if you ignore the generated files.",
