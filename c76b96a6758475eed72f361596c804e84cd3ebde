      "message": "I can\u0027t say I really follow this CL. Looks like you have removed all usage of SubjectMessage::DEPENDENT_DIRTY_BITS, but the declaration (in Observer.h) is still there? If there is a front-end equivalent to what calling this with DEPENDENT_DIRTY_BITS does, it\u0027s not clear to me what that is.\n\nAlso, the behavior here has changed: previously everything would execute the code that follows, but now only STORAGE_CHANGE does that. Is that intentional?",
