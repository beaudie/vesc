      "message": "What does this requirement mean for any projects out there that may be using EGL_ANGLE_direct3d_display, but not trying to use an HWND cross-process? This won\u0027t be an issue once the newer, cleaner extension is out, but if someone\u0027s passed a display ID of EGL_D3D11_ONLY_DISPLAY_ANGLE, that\u0027ll still get propagated into mDc, and they may be single-process. Can we put this behind an on-by-default compiler flag, so that projects that want to do run-time selection of renderer via the old extension, but not use a window handle cross-process, can still do so if they turn off the flag? I don\u0027t know that such a project exists, but if it does, we should try not to break it.",
