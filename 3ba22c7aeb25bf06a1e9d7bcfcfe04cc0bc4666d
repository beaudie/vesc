      "message": "So far it looks like it only helps with AMD (most) and Nvidia. I have yet to try it on Intel, and ask for feedback from imagination. I suspect Imaginations results would be similar to ARM and Qualcomm where this is actually slower than blit after blit.\n\nPerhaps some drivers detect this pattern and use hw mip-generation instead? Anyway, this helps Samsung, so would like to get it in.\n\nThere is some failure with Intel/Windows I have to look into. If I can\u0027t reproduce on Intel/Linux, I\u0027d just disable the path on that configuration.",
