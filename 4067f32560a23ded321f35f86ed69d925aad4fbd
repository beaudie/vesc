      "message": "The thing I worried is that combined with sub-allocation from your previous CL, the offset is going to be change frequently, since the offset here the offsetWithInBuffer+offsetFromSubAllocator, and that can change from each allocation. That will practically defeat the cache. Maybe we should leave the offset/range out of DS cache and always update them even in cache hit?",

      "message": "2 points:\n\n1. I doubt the application would make the transform feedback buffer make new allocations frequently. Chances are they allocate it and just use it.\n2. This only affects transform feedback emulation.\n\nEspecially with #2, are you satisfied that this practically means only swiftshader is affected?",

      "message": "But the exact same issue applies other types of descriptor set cache as well, for example, atomic and storage buffer which does not have the bug this CL try to fix, but also have the same cache miss issue. I was thinking you can fix this and the same mechanism can can be propagate to others.\n\nFor your point #1, you never know how bad app can be, but XFB in general is less common usage anyway. I am okay to deal with cache misses in separate CL.",

      "message": "Actually I think this is not a regression with sub-allocation. As long as you call glBufferData with different size, you basically will have a cache miss. What can be improved here is that in this case, we know that cache likely will miss, we just use a generic buffer/offset/range as the key to find the cached DS and then update it.
