      "message": "sorry, this wasn\u0027t what I meant by internal dirty bit. The GL-level dirty bits have to map to things in the GLES 2.0/3.0/3.1 spec, and this seamless boolean is a GL desktop specific flag. the dirty bits sometimes work in a two-tier method - the top level GL dirty bits are then applied or translated into internal renderer back-end specific dirty bits, which is what would happen with the cube map thing. for now can we leave it in one of the sync methods?",
