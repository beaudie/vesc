      "message": "There isn\u0027t currently any other test file where this test would fit in a natural way. I had copied some of the code here from DebugShaderPrecisionTest and kept the foundInHLSLCode function for future tests - but it\u0027s probably neater to just not have the function here until it\u0027s needed. I removed it now.\n\nAnother option would be to refactor the tests so that there\u0027d be a common base class for tests that look at HLSL output. But that easily ends up in a mess since HLSL support can be toggled at compile time.",
