The `if constexpr` check here will be compile time check, there is no run time cost here.",

No strong opinions, just wondering if having to resort to constexpr checks might be a sign that the code should be structured differently?..",

      "message": "I could move `vk::CommandBufferAccess access` to ContextVk::handleDirtyComputeUniformBuffers() and then pass in commandBufferHelperOrAcess to this function, then I can remove this `if constexpr` check, but you will still have to have the if check in line 2820. It really did not save you from much code duplication. I tried this earlier, but personally I like this slightly better, mainly because it is a bit odd to define access and without using it, just pass to handleDirtyComputeUniformBuffers call is a bit wierd. And it did not make this function more cleaner since I still end up have to do this if constexpr check anway.",
