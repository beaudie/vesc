Personally I rather wouldn\u0027t have as much duplicate testing. If these cover cases that the existing unit tests don\u0027t cover, these could simply be added to unit tests.",

      "message": "I think more test coverage should still be added. The tests below check when the defined operator is evaluated:\n\n#define BBB 1\n#define AAA defined(BBB)\n#undef BBB\n#if AAA\n#endif\n\nand similarly:\n\n#define AAA defined(BBB)\n#define BBB 1\n#if AAA\n#endif\n\nand also:\n\n#define BBB 1\n#define AAA(defi, ned) defi ## ned(BBB)\n#if AAA(defi, ned)\n#endif\n\nand:\n\n#define BBB 1\n#define AAA(defined) defined(BBB)\n#if AAA(defined)\n#endif\n\nAnd does this patch allow \"defined\" used as a macro name? Then some other corner cases become possible, like:\n\n#define AAA 1\n#define defined(B) 1\n#undef defined\n#if defined(AAA)",
