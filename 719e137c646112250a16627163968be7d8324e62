      "message": "lgtm overall\n\nThank you Quyen for jumping on this bug right away.\n\nCould you please talk with Geoff about how to resolve the issue on Chrome Stable and Beta? I imagine this CL could be merged back to Beta, but don\u0027t think it can be merged back to Stable. If it turns out more applications are broken, I wonder whether we should consider reverting your original CL on ANGLE\u0027s branch for Chrome Stable - again, please discuss with Geoff. Thanks.",
