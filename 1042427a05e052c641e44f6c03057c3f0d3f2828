      "message": "Instead of pulling SPIR-V Tools headers into ANGLE/GL, I suggest adding a helper that just returns `mDeviceVersion` and add move this to a function in `clspv_utils.h` that converts the device version to SPIR-V version. You can then keep SPIR-V Tools as a dependency only with CL just like before.\n\nThe change becomes simpler then, at which point you can squash it in the next CL.",
