      "message": "It shouldn\u0027t as long as the front-end sees those new builtins in the list of shader outputs and they are marked active. See VaryingPacking::collectAndPackUserVaryings:\n\n    // Keep track of output builtins that are used by the shader, such as gl_Position,\n    // gl_PointSize etc.\n    if (isActiveBuiltInInput)\n    {\n        mActiveOutputBuiltIns[ref.frontShaderStage].push_back(input-\u003ename);\n    }\n\nYou can try your change on top of this, and if gl_ClipDistance and gl_CullDistance don\u0027t make it inside the if, your implementation is missing something (probably in the translator\u0027s CollectVariables).",
