      "message": "That makes things complicated with desktop GL, there\u0027s a glPointSize() and I\u0027m worried setting it in the shader would override the API setting. I\u0027m not familiar though, I may be wrong.\n\nBut regardless, I do want to have some tests not set gl_PointSize for increased coverage of a SPIR-V transformation we have that would remove it from the list of vertex shader outputs.",
