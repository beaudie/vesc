      "message": "Charlie recommended to look into vertex conversion buffers and it seems we might be able to reuse that? There is already some `dirty` flag handling in these so maybe that would work here as well? It seems I\u0027m able to get a \"vertex conversion\" buffer but use it for texels here. I ended up resetting mBufferViews as in syncState where it is initialized we don\u0027t seem to have access to `isImage` which is what we need to set up the correct offset/size. `getVertexConversionBuffer` doesn\u0027t take `size` however so I suppose this won\u0027t work when we set up a range at the same offset but with a different size.",
