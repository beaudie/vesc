      "message": "A maybe better alternative for this patch would be to not emit the `glBindVertexArray` at all on GLES1 contexts, which was introduced with `fd89020c25f51a1e70b8a4d8c0ea633516dcecbe`, since it makes all GLES1 traces captured with MEC depend on `GL_OES_vertex_array_object`, even if the extension is not used otherwise. This for example has issues on native drivers like Mesa, which seemingly don\u0027t support the extension on GLES1.",
