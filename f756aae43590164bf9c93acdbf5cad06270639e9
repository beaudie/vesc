      "message": "Hear me out. I think we should remove the data defs above and make all copy rules explicit. I took a look at the CMake. They copy all the data to a temporary directory. So there would be a few advantages:\n\n * we\u0027d most closely match CMake\n * we wouldn\u0027t need as many crazy shenanigans to detect the data directory in ANGLE\n * the data dirs would be consistent for KHR/graphicsfuzz/normal dEQP tests and any new tests\n\nDownsides:\n\n * we don\u0027t have the ability to copy folders and each file must be named manually\n\nThis is mostly a one time cost that I was happy to skip when writing these files. At this point it\u0027s worth spending the ten minutes to convert \u0027ls\u0027 output into GN copy rules. WDYT?",
