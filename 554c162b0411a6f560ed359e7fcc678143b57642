      "message": "These DrawBuffersTests are failing because `VK_EXT_primitives_generated_query` has been enabled but its dependent extension `VK_EXT_transform_feedback` has not (the tests disable that feature explicitly).  If in `DrawBuffersTest.cpp::ANGLE_INSTANTIATE_TEST()` I add `.disable(Feature::SupportsPrimitivesGeneratedQuery` to the parameters the tests all pass indicating an ANGLE issue.  Earlier drivers do not support `VK_EXT_primitives_generated_query` so the error was avoided.",
