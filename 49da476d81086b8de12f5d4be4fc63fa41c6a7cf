      "message": "Adding Roman who also had opinions on reduced precision in trace diffs.\n\nI would rather have a controlled set of known tests/platform/GPU combinations that we allow to vary.  I prefer having a human in the loop deciding if the changes are acceptably minor.  I think most of us are okay glancing at a screenshot diff and accepting/declining changes.  But it would be nice to remove the skips in TracePerfTest.cpp.\n\nMaybe we add a follow on project to connect an expectations file to this?",
