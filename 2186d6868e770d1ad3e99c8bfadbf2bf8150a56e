      "message": "according to Kimmo this is supposed to fail due to `EXPECT_FALSE(hasPixmapExt());` in ImageTest (src/tests/gl_tests/ImageTest.cpp). That makes sense I suppose; I did run the unittests but I guess this one is not included in that since it relies on native platform code (which cannot be made to work in my container).\n\nThat said, I am not sure if the test itself makes sense to me. If I\u0027m reading it correctly, Linux is covered by the final `else` branch? How should I change the test?",
