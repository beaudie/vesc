      "message": "It is the variability between ICDs on how many descriptors are needed for an immutable sampler that results in such errors.\n\n\u003e who is responsible for the allocation failure\n\nVulkan spec allows for failures, ANGLE needs to be updated to handle this error code. Repro case would need specific configs in bots that have certain descriptor count requirements for immutable samplers.\n\nThis is not invalid code according to Vulkan spec, so what am i missing?",

      "message": "\u003e If the allocation fails due to no more space in the descriptor pool, and not because of system or device memory exhaustion, then VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_POOL_MEMORY must be returned.\n\nThis reads to me as an ANGLE internal error where we try to allocate too many descriptor sets from a pool. We shouldn\u0027t code ANGLE to be robust to internal errors, if this is the case. We should track down and fix the ANGLE code that\u0027s allocating too many - we\u0027re supposed to be doing bookkeeping to know how many sets are in a pool. It\u0027s possible YUV descriptor set accounting is borked.",
