Repro case would need specific configs in bots that have certain descriptor count requirements for immutable samplers.\n\nThis is not invalid code according to Vulkan spec, so what am i missing?",

      "message": "\u003e If the allocation fails due to no more space in the descriptor pool, and not because of system or device memory exhaustion, then VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_POOL_MEMORY must be returned.\n\nThis reads to me as an ANGLE internal error where we try to allocate too many descriptor sets from a pool. We shouldn\u0027t code ANGLE to be robust to internal errors, if this is the case. We should track down and fix the ANGLE code that\u0027s allocating too many - we\u0027re supposed to be doing bookkeeping to know how many sets are in a pool. It\u0027s possible YUV descriptor set accounting is borked.",
