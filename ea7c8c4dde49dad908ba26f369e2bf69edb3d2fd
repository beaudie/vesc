      "message": "This is probably going to be very fragile. We use mBaseLevel all over the place, and we need to very carefully understand when we should use mFirstLevel.\n\nI don\u0027t currently have a good idea that involves not storing this. So I\u0027d at least suggest renaming these three variables to:\n\n    gl::LevelIndex mAllocationBaseLevel;\n    gl::LevelIndex mViewBaseLevel;\n    gl::LevelIndex mViewMaxLevel;\n\nThat would also force you to go through all usages of mBaseLevel and think about what makes sense. Similarly, getBaseLevel() should be renamed to getViewBaseLevel() etc.",
