Please consider adding an overview of how command queue works, what the responsibilities of the async thread are etc in a file under `../vulkan/doc/`, it\u0027ll be good to have the logic behind our past discussions that led to this design captured somewhere.",

      "message": "Speaking from experience, it\u0027ll be hard to reason about the async thread operating on the same object as the main thread (like guaranteeing thread-safety, which parts of the object are accessible to which thread).\n\nUnless the async thread is supposed to have access to _everything_ in CLCommandQueueVk, you\u0027re better off splitting at least its state into a dedicated class with a restricted interface.",
