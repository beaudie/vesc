      "message": "This is not for this case (but may do this in the future if needed).\n\nThis is to temporary set `SharedContexMutex` for `eglQueryContext()` case, for example and then revert back to `SingleContextMutex`.\n\nIn other words this is for all cases, when Context is single in the group and uses `SingleContextMutex` but we need to access `Context` from other threads. `Context::markContextLost()` is another such example (currently `Display::notifyDeviceLost()` will do this without locks). In this cases `SharedContexMutex` will be set temporarily and then changed back to `SingleContextMutex`.\n\nTo clarify. This change may be later used to revert back to `SingleContextMutex` when context become single in the group again. But need to also account for merged mutexes...\n\nChange is not simple and requires a lot of code change and I do not want to have big -/+ diff in the follow up.",
