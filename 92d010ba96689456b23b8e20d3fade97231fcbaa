      "message": "Thanks! My only concern with this change is that the calculation in `calculateVMAPreferredBlockSize` may be too specific to one app. Like it\u0027s trying to fit a 256x512 RGBA images perfectly in VMA blocks, but that may very well not apply to most apps. Have you made sure this doesn\u0027t regress memory elsewhere?\n\nFWIW, _most_ of an application\u0027s images are typically in compressed formats. If this adds padding for such images where there wasn\u0027t any before, that\u0027d be significant.",
