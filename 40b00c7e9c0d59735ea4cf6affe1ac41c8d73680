      "message": "I should probably add a simple integer-based driver ID filter as well. On the Linux AMD side, it\u0027s difficult to distinguish RADV, AMD proprietary, AMD open source, etc. because it looks like all three drivers use the same deviceUUID and driverUUID. *sigh*\n\nUnfortunately, I think the driver ID is only available through a VK 1.2 structure or through the VK_KHR_driver_properties extension:\n\nhttps://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceDriverProperties.html\n\nhttps://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan12Properties.html",

      "message": "Okay, I\u0027ve added support for filtering by `VkDriverId` as well. I followed the lead of the VulkanHelper.cpp in passing the `VkPhysicalDeviceDriverProperties` in pNext without checking for extension support -- from what I can tell there are no VVLs for unsupported structure types with `vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2`?\n\nOpen questions:\n\n- Is it OK to have `VkPhysicalDeviceDriverProperties` in pNext without checking for `VK_KHR_driver_properties` via `vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties`?\n\n- Should I be also handling `EGL_DONT_CARE` for the new `EGLAttrib`s? It seems like the `AttributeMap::get` function, specifically the variant with the `defaultValue` argument, could (but doesn\u0027t) handle `EGL_DONT_CARE`, returning `defaultValue` either on `EGL_DONT_CARE` or when the attribute is not present.",

      "message": "EGL extensions usually specify a default backwards compatible value for new attributes when they are not specified. EGL_DONT_CARE is ok, or 0, whatever makes sense for the context but there is no universal value that AttributeMap::get should handle. You probably want to use EGL_DONT_CARE here and specify it the same way as NULL for the other parameters.",
