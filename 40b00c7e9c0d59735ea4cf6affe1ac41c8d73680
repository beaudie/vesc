On the Linux AMD side, it\u0027s difficult to distinguish RADV, AMD proprietary, AMD open source, etc. because it looks like all three drivers use the same deviceUUID and driverUUID. *sigh*\n\nUnfortunately, I think the driver ID is only available through a VK 1.2 structure or through the VK_KHR_driver_properties extension:\n\nhttps://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceDriverProperties.html\n\nhttps://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan12Properties.html",
