      "message": "I should probably add a simple integer-based driver ID filter as well. On the Linux AMD side, it\u0027s difficult to distinguish RADV, AMD proprietary, AMD open source, etc. because it looks like all three drivers use the same deviceUUID and driverUUID. *sigh*\n\nUnfortunately, I think the driver ID is only available through a VK 1.2 structure or through the VK_KHR_driver_properties extension:\n\nhttps://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceDriverProperties.html\n\nhttps://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan12Properties.html",

      "message": "Okay, I\u0027ve added support for filtering by `VkDriverId` as well. I followed the lead of the VulkanHelper.cpp in passing the `VkPhysicalDeviceDriverProperties` in pNext without checking for extension support -- from what I can tell there are no VVLs for unsupported structure types with `vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2`?\n\nOpen questions:\n\n- Is it OK to have `VkPhysicalDeviceDriverProperties` in pNext without checking for `VK_KHR_driver_properties` via `vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties`?\n\n- Should I be also handling `EGL_DONT_CARE` for the new `EGLAttrib`s? It seems like the `AttributeMap::get` function, specifically the variant with the `defaultValue` argument, could (but doesn\u0027t) handle `EGL_DONT_CARE`, returning `defaultValue` either on `EGL_DONT_CARE` or when the attribute is not present.",
