      "message": "Doesn\u0027t this undo the benefits of `SharedPtr`? `SharedPtr` is managing the lifetime of the refcounted thing (so that `releaseRef` can automatically destroy the resource). I see this pointer is now taken out and cached in `mDescriptorSetCache`, that removes the ability for SharedPtr to manage the lifetime.\n\nMaybe there\u0027s a way to make this safer. One usage is just checking if the pointers are the same, you could add an `operator\u003d\u003d` for that instead. For `mDescriptorSetCache`, I haven\u0027t read too carefully yet to know what can be done.",
