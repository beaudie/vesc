      "message": "This sounds like a bug in the Vulkan backend. The application is perfectly allowed to render with a renderbuffer, delete it, then flush. The `retain()` calls should have made sure everything is ok.\n\nYou should be able to write a separate regression test exactly to do that: use renderbuffer to draw, delete it, then EXPECT_PIXEL_COLOR_EQ.\n\n+Jamie",

I/Courtney did the following:\n\n- I removed this test code in the follow-on CL (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/2378670) that you +1\u0027d.\n\n- Courtney reverted the change (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/2368194) that was the underlying problem (revert: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/2380610)\n\n- I have a better change than the above is in the CL that moves mContentDefined to ImageHelper for depth/stencil (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/2386478)",
