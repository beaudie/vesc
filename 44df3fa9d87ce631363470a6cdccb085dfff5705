      "message": "This sounds like a bug in the Vulkan backend. The application is perfectly allowed to render with a renderbuffer, delete it, then flush. The `retain()` calls should have made sure everything is ok.\n\nYou should be able to write a separate regression test exactly to do that: use renderbuffer to draw, delete it, then EXPECT_PIXEL_COLOR_EQ.\n\n+Jamie",
