(You wouldn\u0027t need it in FenceSyncTests.cpp because it\u0027s the same thread creating and waiting, there\u0027s spec language about this being ok without flush).\n\nIt works in VANGLE due to the way contexts flush their command buffers to the shared renderer, but doesn\u0027t necessarily work in other GL implementations.",

      "message": "It works locally on Nvidia without the flushes, but seems SwS on the bots isn\u0027t happy without them even with how VANGLE works.   Makes sense, since the call may never make it without them since we\u0027re only flushing all of the work up to the fence, but not the fence itself.",
