      "message": "When capturing dead_by_daylight I found a regression introduced by 462cdb08e395edbf5bace1408715e35239a0b1fa that deleted all resources created in `SetupReplay` in `ResetReplay`.\nI found several inconsistencies in `mStartingResources` and `mNewResources` tracking that prevented that patch to work correctly with MEC.\nThis patch fixes capture for `dead_by_daylight`. I did not test other apps yet.",
