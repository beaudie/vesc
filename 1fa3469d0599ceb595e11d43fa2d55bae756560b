      "message": "That measures something different though, since it never makes it into the VK driver itself to do all of the associated work for a particular call.   It\u0027s possible ANGLE is doing something \"bad\" and performing lots of driver calls whose overhead can be measurable (versus coalescing them or some other fix) that would otherwise be hidden by the mock ICD returning immediately.\n\nThis type of change gives a more accurate overall view of the CPU workload since it measures things more end-to-end, rather than just what ANGLE is doing.",

      "message": "I guess they are complimentary. ANGLE could also potentially change its behavior based on the call parameters. Simple example is nooping draw calls whose count parameter is too small, but it could potentially also do other things, like changing behavior based on render area size, or deciding to flush based on a measure of how much work has been accumulated.\n\nContradicting myself, ANGLE also changes behavior based on driver features, so Mock ICD is also not representative.",
