      "message": "Without having looked at how clampArrayAccess works, it looks to me like the condition should have really been \"!functions-\u003ehasExtension(\"GL_KHR_robust_buffer_access_behavior\")\". I imagine there\u0027s overhead added in the form of clamp, which is unnecessary if the driver supports robust access, isn\u0027t that right?",

Drivers\u0027 actual behavior seems to not quite follow the extension spec, and fails the WebGL conformance test. (The test may have to be updated.) The plan is to enable clampArrayAccess only for WebGL contexts.",
