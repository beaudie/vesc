      "message": "This is good work!  I did an initial review.  I\u0027d like to do another pass, and probably watch the code in a debugger before doing another pass.\n\nCharlie and I discussed testing via Chat.  This is a large enough change that we\u0027ll want to redo the pre-rotation testing that I used to do.  It basically involves running the ANGLE version of dEQP, end2end tests, etc. while forcing the device into all 4 rotations.  We have to run tests with Identity to establish a baseline, since Pixel 4 gets different results than Pixel 2.\n\n[ ] CHECK STILL: Probably answered in the next CL: do shaders ever need to be recompiled?  I see a flag for whether to compile them with/without the specialization constant.",
