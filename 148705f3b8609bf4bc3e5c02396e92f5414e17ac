      "message": "FYI ... this was going to be fixed by crrev/c/2386478 (abandoned), which was the 3rd proposed approach for a fix.  All 3 of the proposed approaches suffered from objects that CAN going away without the ContextVk or CommandBufferHelper being informed (i.e. FramebufferVk, RenderTargetVk, and ImageHelper).\n\nA 4th option is to use the subject-observer pattern to communicate to CommandBufferHelper when ImageHelper/RenderTargetVk goes away.  Jamie did not want to pursue that approach.\n\nSince T-Rex does an invalidate and endRP, and since we don\u0027t know whether a draw will occur, we assume no draw will occur.  Thus, if a draw occurs, we won\u0027t save/load the contents.  It was decided to not fix this bug until an application is found that does this scenario.",
