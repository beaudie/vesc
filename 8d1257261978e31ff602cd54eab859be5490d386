      "message": "I added this bool to prevent this code from being entered for non-instanced rendering calls using divisors of non-zero.  To support that case, the emulation would require the outer for-loop to properly render each instanced attribute correctly.\nI ran ES3 dEQP points rendering tests and discovered that non-instanced GL render calls with divisors of non-zero do not work with this emulation without major additions to the non-instanced code paths.  That will have to come in a later patch as it is most likely more intrusive.\nSeems odd to set a divisor and not use the instanced version of the api call, but it is being in the dEQP tests.  The GL documentation suggest using the instanced calls for non-zero divisors.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",
