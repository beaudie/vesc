      "message": "I added this bool to prevent this code from being entered for non-instanced rendering calls using divisors of non-zero.  To support that case, the emulation would require the outer for-loop to properly render each instanced attribute correctly.\nI ran ES3 dEQP points rendering tests and discovered that non-instanced GL render calls with divisors of non-zero do not work with this emulation without major additions to the non-instanced code paths.  That will have to come in a later patch as it is most likely more intrusive.\nSeems odd to set a divisor and not use the instanced version of the api call, but it is being in the dEQP tests.  The GL documentation suggest using the instanced calls for non-zero divisors.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

      "message": "Can you reference where the spec (or docs) where you\u0027re referring to? My main desire is to keep the intrusiveness, extra parameters, etc as miminal as we can to keep the code relatively clean and maintainable. I don\u0027t understand the patches too well, but am hoping that if I do we can maybe figure out a way to keep it as clean as we can. Which tests, (if any) does the bool instancedRenderingUsed flag make pass?",
