      "message": "Because this is a polling loop. I don\u0027t want to overtax one thread/core.\n\nThis is 100ms and it runs in a master process that doesn\u0027t run any tests. The tests all run in child processes. This is an area of code most people aren\u0027t familiar with. See https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle/+/refs/changes/36/2407836/2/src/tests/test_utils/runner for some limited info.\n\nThe reason I was experimenting with changing the polling frequency is because spinning up \"max CPUs\" processes was causing crashes on my Linux workstation. I wasn\u0027t sure if it was because too many graphics contexts were being created at once so I tried throttling them a little bit. That didn\u0027t seem to help. Using a limit of 16 seemed to work. I left this in because it seemed like a reasonable improvement to not poll so much and space out the work.",
