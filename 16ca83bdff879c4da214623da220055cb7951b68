      "message": "I\u0027m outputting color in the vertex shader, that gets interpolated between the corners. That means none of the values that are read back are going to be precisely known. I could probably work out the numbers and add a tolerance of 1.\n\nIn this test though, you can\u0027t \"accidentally\" be close to a color, so I don\u0027t think this would create false positives. On my laptop, the values were 2 and 253, so a tolerance of 2 (or 3) would make the bots pass too, but correctness-wise, 5 and 3 don\u0027t make a difference.",
