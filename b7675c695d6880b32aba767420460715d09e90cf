      "message": "The multisample-related test failures are concerning. I can reproduce them locally and it looks like they\u0027re using the direct-to-Metal compiler, which shouldn\u0027t be possible. In working on https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/3076129 I got my build into a state where the code claimed it was using the SPIR-V Metal compiler, but was actually using the direct-to-Metal compiler. A clean rebuild fixed the problem. Highly concerned that our build products don\u0027t have all dependencies listed. Looking into BUILD.gn files now.\n",
