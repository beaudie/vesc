      "message": "PTAL. I ended up having to wrap everything and add the ++mSize because there are a number of places we need the answer to the query \"empty()\", and some times all the command buffer has is a pipeline barrier, or some such thing. Some functions are not wrapped, like bindXYZ because they are always accompanied by a draw call. In fact, what\u0027s bound is undone at the end of the command buffer, so we can\u0027t meaningfully have a command buffer that only binds things.\n\nAside from the excessive wrapping, the user-side code does look much nicer now.",
