      "message": "It\u0027s strange I never saw email notifications about comments made on https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/2857366.\n\nI did comment that shadow sampler compare mode\u0027s uniform value is not needed by current upstream\u0027s spirv-cross based translator because overriding spirv-cross is undesired.\n\nBut Apple\u0027s direct msl translator might need this to work properly once it becomes default in future. I assume their translator also does similar shadow sampler\u0027s work-arounds. So not sure this should be removed here and re-added in future.\n\nOr we can keep both this and spriv-cross\u0027s shadow sampler\u0027s overriding code. The latter inserts a custom \"ANGLEShadowCompareModes\" uniform variable to shaders. So they both need to be kept or removed together.",
