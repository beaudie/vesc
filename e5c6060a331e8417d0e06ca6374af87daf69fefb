I can check with Yuly what happened to this configuration.\n\n\u003e Does this run on pixel 4 bots as well? If so, might need to check if still problematic there, possibly selectively disable for pixel 4.\n\nThe CQ test for this CL (patchset 5) was passing on `android-arm64-test`, which runs on Pixel 4. Is it ok to enable it on Pixel 4 and monitor on bots? If it is causing flakiness I can disable it for Pixel 4 later.",
