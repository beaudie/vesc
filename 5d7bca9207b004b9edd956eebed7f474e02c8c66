      "message": "Not sure if I will be able to do that.\n\n`hasProtectedContent()` originates from `gl::State` which is common layer.\nThere are also many other such functions in other classes and they are abstract.\n\nAdditionally, what the name of the enum should be? Because I do not understand what new items may appear in the future. And if there will be some additional items, splitting `CmdsState` structure for the new item may be incorrect. Because right now, there must be only 2 `CmdsState` instances - future is unknown.\n\nSo maybe just keep 2 separate `CommandsState` members (assuming renaming):\n```\nCommandsState \u0026getCmmandsState(bool hasProtectedContent)\n{\n    return hasProtectedContent ? mProtectedCommandsStateMap : mCommandsStateMap;\n}\n ```",

      "message": "Yeah. I know it is resolved, I really wanted to made changes, but than stumbled.\n\nRegarding name. For me `CommandPriority` is confusing with `egl::ContextPriority`. Maybe you wanted to write \u0027CommandContent\u0027?\n\n\u003e I was thinking of something that\u0027s internal to the Vulkan backend (so bool-\u003eenum happening somewhere in the backend)\n\nMost methods pure virtual and need to keep `bool`.\n\nAnd for the `ContextVk::hasProtectedContent()` I think it is better to add additional method with enum. Otherwise there will be conversion to `bool` in the `QueryContextAttrib()`.\n\nAnyway, I need to submit this refactoring. And for that I need at lest rename `Cmds*` to `Commands*`. Also move `CmdsContentType` out of the class, but with the different name. Refactoring in other classes add later with different CL.",
