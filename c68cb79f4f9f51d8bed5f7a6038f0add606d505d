      "message": "In 99.9999% of the times, there won\u0027t be a `ClearEmulatedChannelsOnly` update, so this loop will be a no-op. To keep the complexity of this function in check, I suggest moving this loop into a helper, like `flushStagedClearEmulatedChannelsUpdates()` which can even `pop_front()` the updates.\n\nYou can still have a `bool *otherUpdatesToFlushOut` if you want to optimize away the following `getOutsideRenderPassCommandBufferHelper`",

      "message": "Thanks. Moved the loop into `flushStagedClearEmulatedChannelsUpdates()`.\n* Regarding removing the updates, we are currently using `erase()` for this, since vectors do not have `pop_front()`.\n* In addition, since `ClearEmulatedChannelsOnly` can only be in the beginning and we cannot have several of such updates in the list, we may be able to reduce the complexity even further (assumptions based on `verifyEmulatedClearsAreBeforeOtherUpdates()`).\n  * Additionally, the second for-loop has been reduced to checking the first update in the list.",
