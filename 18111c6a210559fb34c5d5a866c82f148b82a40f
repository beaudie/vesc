      "message": "This seems like the wrong course of action to me. ANGLE\u0027s implementation of GL_EXT_texture_border_clamp on top of Vulkan is known to be broken for cases that can affect any conformant VK_EXT_custom_border_color implementations, not just SwiftShader\u0027s.\n\nI suggest disabling GL_EXT_texture_border_clamp altogether, letting the SwiftShader implementation land, and then re-enable the extension when the ANGLE issue is fixed.",
