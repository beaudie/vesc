Otherwise, the app just compiles the programs sometime later (I\u0027m not sure when though).\n\nHowever, I also had to hack ANGLE to prevent from trying to capture these calls (I removed the ANGLE_CAPTURE() call from the entry point).   Otherwise, the UNIMPLEMENTED() calls would be emitted while the app was running, and the replay would crash since the glGetProgramBinary() calls in the trace had bad values.",
