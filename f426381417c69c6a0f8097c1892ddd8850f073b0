      "message": "Nice work Jonah triaging the remaining failures.\n\nThere are still quite a lot, and I\u0027m concerned that by losing the DirectMetalGen suffix on the test names, we\u0027ll lose the ability to easily understand what are regressions compared to the SPIR-V backend.\n\nWhat would you think about the following approach?\n\n1) Change ANGLE_TEST_INSTANTIATE for the dEQP test suites, starting with dEQP/ES2, to additionally run the direct-to-Metal tests.\n\n2) Burn down those failures to a relatively small number.\n\n3) Make the switch at that point.\n\nIs this feasible? Do the dEQP tests instantiate backends in the same way angle_end2end_tests do?\n\nA couple of other suggestions:\n\nA) Would it be possible to add an \"IsDirectToMetal()\" or \"IsSPIRVMetal()\" predicate? It looks like that would allow a substantial number of tests to be turned on right now with the direct-to-Metal backend; that would be ideal.\n\nB) When making the Metal test expectation changes, could they be done in the same place in the various files? In this CL they move, which makes it difficult to do side-by-side comparisons.\n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts on these.\n",
