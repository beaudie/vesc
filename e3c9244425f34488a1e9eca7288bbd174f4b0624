      "message": "Right, it may well be a real bug in the NVIDIA driver, either way I think the tolerance in this test should be increased, or at least the test should be run with highp. I\u0027m a bit curious though how you ended up incorporating atan() into the test case, as it doesn\u0027t seem like a very minimal case? Is it just to get around some quirks in the compiler?",
