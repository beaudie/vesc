      "message": "Since you are double compiling the shader anyway, could you change things such that the actual `@@ XFB-DECL @@` and `@@ XFB-OUT @@` are modified once for with xfb and once for without xfb? Then you can get rid of the `ANGLE_ENABLE_XFB_EMULATION` macro (and probably all the changes in this file).\n\nThe reason is anglebug.com/4889. Transform feedback patches will soon no longer be applied on the source but in SPIR-V itself. A hack like this would be hard to work with.",
