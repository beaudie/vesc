Why would they go away if accessed when something like ReplayContext1Frame1() is executed twice?\n\n\u003e the string pointer is no good on the second run through\n\nWhat does \"no good\" mean?   It\u0027s pointing to somewhere random or the string itself is being corrupted somehow?\n\nDoes this happen with native and ANGLE playbacks, or just one of them?",
