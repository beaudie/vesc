Could you please do something similar to `CopySubImageAlpha` above, where the backbuffer is initialized to some color before the copy (glCopyTexSubImage3DOES), and then a shader is used to verify the copy worked fine (remember to reclear the buffer to another color before the draw).",

      "message": "Thanks. I couldn\u0027t find the shader functions to draw with the 2D array texture (e.g., `texture2DArrayLod()`). I checked out the spec for the extension: https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/extensions/OES/OES_texture_3D.txt\n\nIt seems that this extension only adds support for 3D textures. Therefore, I think the validation should fail for 2D arrays. Is it correct? If so, this can be achieved by updating `ValidTexture3DDestinationTarget()` to check the version.",
