I really want to understand what the difference is here.",

That\u0027s why I was always seeing API commands written to \"angle_debug.txt\".\n\nI\u0027d like to detangle some things and make sure we have a clear way to enable all of the relevant paths, workflows, use cases, etc.  I didn\u0027t understand them all, and they are not clearly documented in the code.  I\u0027d like to understand and make them all work.\n\nOne problem is that I used \"angle_enable_trace \u003d true\" to enable debug markers for AGI.  We need a different GN arg/flag.  Tobin\u0027s CL didn\u0027t use DebugAnnotator AND used a different GN arg/flag to enable markers.  It had a lot of #ifdef\u0027s.  I removed the #ifdef\u0027s and went with \"angle_enable_trace\", which caused problems I didn\u0027t realize.  I\u0027m sorry about that!",
