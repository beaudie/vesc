      "message": "Our usage of the ext is still very wrong, we\u0027re supposed to select which counters to capture, and treat the capture as happening on the GPU pipeline (i.e. need to wait for it to happen), but what we had before this change was even more wrong; we didn\u0027t even begin/end the capture.\n\nI don\u0027t think it\u0027s worth doing this _more_ properly now, I did this just to add control over when capture happens as the next CL could add more overhead if counters are always captured for no reason.",

I didn\u0027t even realize we can capture counters in perf tests, have you ever used that? If so, could you please verify this change doesn\u0027t break that use case?
