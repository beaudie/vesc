The failing test seems to be a tessellation one, and we\u0027re obviously exposing some feature we shouldn\u0027t be (because the non-conformant build setting is set, or maybe we missed something).\n\nIt\u0027s best IMO to skip the test than the VVL message.",

In truth, we should neither be exposing tessellation nor ES3.2 on ARM (or anywhere really), because we are not yet conformant and all bets are off.\n\nSince the goal is to quickly set up P6s, I wouldn\u0027t worry about suppressing geomtry/tessellation tests wholesale.",
