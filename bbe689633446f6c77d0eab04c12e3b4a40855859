      "message": "It looks to me like this was resulting in ANGLE declaring ES3.1 support even if `getMaxSupportedESVersion` returned ES3 or ES2, right?! That\u0027s probably the cause of the new failures. It\u0027d be interesting to know what\u0027s stopping SwiftShader from supporting ES3.1. For Pixel4, no hope I guess.\n\nBut anyway, we could at least move the `|| exposeNonConformantExtensionsAndVersions` to the exact features that are causing trouble so we know where to look for in the future to fix them.",
