      "message": "In terms of getting the build going, I don\u0027t see anything wrong with this, but be warned that building this way means ANGLE loses its ability to invalidate its caches next time you update ANGLE and build again. The result could be hard-to-debug failures as shaders and programs are loaded from an incompatible version.\n\nI\u0027d strongly suggest building ANGLE in a more reliable way instead of this change.",

      "message": "We have changed how ANGLE validates shader program cache: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/4144078/13/src/libANGLE/Program.cpp. It used to use `angle::GetANGLECommitHash()` to check if the shader program cache should be invalidated, but now it uses a different code `angle::GetANGLEShaderProgramVersion()`, which is decoupled from `angle::GetANGLECommitHash()`.\n\nThe only places I found in code that are still using `angle::GetANGLECommitHash()`, are:\n\nchromium/src/gpu/command_buffer/service/program_cache.cc.\nchromium/src/content/browser/gpu/gpu_internals_ui.cc.\n\nI don\u0027t have full knowledge on whether they can affect ANGLE usage on Android builds. But on Android builds, there is no guarantee that git is available: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/3615014/comment/159b2b5b_576de053/. So the chances that `angle::GetANGLECommitHash()` remains unknown on Android builds already exist. Thus I don\u0027t think this change is creating a potential issue that did not exist before..",
