      "message": "I\u0027m not sure this is a step forward for future JavaScript bindings of this extension. At the JS level, what would the argument type be? Per https://registry.khronos.org/webgl/specs/latest/1.0/ - probably sequence\u0026lt;GLfloat\u0026gt, or an ArrayBuffer which was packed together using DataView. A sequence of \"any\" would lead to developer confusion - what are the elements of the sequence? Under the hood, the Blink engine\u0027s C++ code will need to keep track of the formats of all of the pixel local storage planes, to know whether to coerce each 4-tuple into a float or an int before repacking it for the call to BeginPixelLocalStorageANGLE.\n\nIf you really want to go in this direction I\u0027ll approve this, but the developer ergonomics seem poor.",
