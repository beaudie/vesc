      "message": "Can this function be named something which conveys that it\u0027s a one of the draw-time oriented functions, which relies on current program bindings, rather than a more purely informational one, as most of the functions beginning with \"get\" are? It\u0027s a bit nitpicky, but I think it\u0027s an important distinction.",
