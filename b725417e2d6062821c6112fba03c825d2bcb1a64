      "message": "LGTM. Could you please add a state-change test to make sure state transitions are handled correctly? I\u0027ve been adding these when implementing dynamic state in the Vulkan backend. See for example:\n\n```\nTEST_P(StateChangeTestES3, RasterizerDiscard)\nTEST_P(StateChangeTestES3, PolygonOffsetFill)\nTEST_P(StateChangeTestES3, PrimitiveRestart)\nTEST_P(StateChangeTestES3, StencilTestAndFunc)\n```\n\nEach test tries to minimally change state between draw calls and only validate the result in the end, to make sure the state change is taken into account only when that\u0027s basically the only state change (as much as possible).",

      "message": "This pattern is implicitly covered by `DrawLinesWithDepthOffset`:\n\n- L314-L342: two draw calls interleaved with polygon mode and offset state changes, a check afterwards;\n- L344-L378: two more draw calls interleaved with similar state changes, a check in the end.\n\nThese should cover Vulkan state transitions for now because polygon mode becomes dynamic only with EDS3, which is not implemented yet.",
