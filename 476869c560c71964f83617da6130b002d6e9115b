      "message": "To avoid rounding issues, I suggest fractions that play well with typical sizes (like 1920x1080). Assuming every screen size has dimensions that are at least multiple of 8, you could make the ratios like:\n\n- 7/8 (87.5%)\n- 6/8 (75%)\n- 5/8 (62.5%)\n- 4/8 (50%)\n- 3/8 (37.5%) (I personally wouldn\u0027t even go below 50%, but never hurts to have the option)\n\nYou will end up with 5 options instead of 6. I don\u0027t know if this would be good for aliasing or bad, so you could try it out and see if visually it makes things better or worse.\n\n---\n\nEdit: I also see some issues with float later in the change (like scissor and viewport scaling). With the above change, you also don\u0027t need to do anything in floating point.",
