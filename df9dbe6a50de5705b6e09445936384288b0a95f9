The use of the word \"device\" is fine but when paired with the word \"id\", there needs to be clarification about what is what.\n\nIf people feel strongly that we should use the term device id then the spec should make clear:\n1) ANGLE device id !\u003d PCI device id \n2) Clarify that the id assignment does not persist across reboots.\n3) Give examples of how device id maps to platform concepts, including Swiftshader. \nSaves readers the trouble of rummaging through the code to figure this out.",
