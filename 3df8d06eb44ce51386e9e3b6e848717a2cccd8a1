      "message": "I\u0027m inspecting the images visually, but I\u0027m not doing the full imagemagick analysis of QC vs ARM vs Nvidia.\n\nIs there a reason to gate submitting these on imagemagick analysis?   These traces can always be updated, and submitting them gives everyone access to the traces vs trying to pass around tar files and cherrypick CLs.   We also get at least some coverage with the new traces in the meantime.",

      "message": "Once they are checked in and running in Skia Gold, it only compares against previous ANGLE results.  It never compares against the native driver.  So you\u0027re effectively establishing that ANGLE is getting the correct result, and eyeballing it isn\u0027t good enough.  We don\u0027t want to compare against a bad image forever, not knowing that we\u0027re missing geometry or shading which can be very difficult to spot.\n\nComparing against native only takes a few minutes with the steps I\u0027ve sent you previously.  It ends up being a judgement call, since we almost never completely match the native driver.  Another reason to document it.\n\nWe don\u0027t need to gate this CL on the results, the comparison can be done as a follow up.",
