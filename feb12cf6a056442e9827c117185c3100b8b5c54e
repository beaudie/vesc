      "message": "It looks like a real bug since it\u0027s failing consistently on all GPUs.\n\nThe problem I believe is that there\u0027s logic (storageRedefined) that\u0027s duplicated in both the front-end and the back-end. In a sense, the front-end is trying to guess what the backend will do. It looks to me like the d3d9 backend is behaving differently to what the front-end expects, leading to errors.\n\nI think the best way to solve this is to not second guess the back-end, and let the back-end itself notify when storage has changed.",
