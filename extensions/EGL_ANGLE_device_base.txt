Number

    EGL Extension #XXX

Extension Type

    EGL client extension

Dependencies

    Written against the wording of EGL 1.5.

    Requires EGL 1.5 or an earlier verison of EGL with the
    EGL_EXT_client_extensions extension.

Overview

    Increasingly, EGL and its client APIs are being used in place of
    "native" rendering APIs to implement the basic graphics
    functionality of native windowing systems.  This creates demand
    for a method to access native GPU or device objects directly
    rather than calling EGL or GL entry points.

    This extension defines the method for an application to query
    native device objects from an EGL Display.

New Types

    This is the type of a handle that represents an EGLDeviceANGLE
    object.

        typedef void* EGLDeviceANGLE;

    If EGL 1.5 is not supported, the following type is added, as
    defined in the EGL 1.5 specification:

        typedef intptr_t EGLAttrib;

New Functions

    EGLBoolean eglQueryDeviceAttribANGLE(EGLDeviceANGLE device,
                                         EGLint attribute,
                                         EGLAttrib *value);

    EGLBoolean eglQueryDisplayAttribANGLE(EGLDisplay dpy,
                                          EGLint attribute,
                                          EGLAttrib *value);

New Tokens

    Functions with a return type of EGLDeviceANGLE will return this
    value on failure:

        EGL_NO_DEVICE_ANGLE                      ((EGLDeviceANGLE)0)

    This error value will be generated by functions that take an
    EGLDeviceANGLE object as a parameter:

        EGL_BAD_DEVICE_ANGLE                     0x322B

    Accepted by the <attribute> parameter of
    eglQueryDisplayAttribANGLE:

        EGL_DEVICE_ANGLE                         0x322C

Add a new section "2.1.2 Devices" after "2.1.1 Scalar Types"

    All EGL operations occur on an EGLDeviceANGLE.  However, devices
    themselves expose no functionality.  They are simple abstract
    objects that exist only for the sake of enumeration and
    defining a namespace.

Modify the last sentence of section "2.1.3" Displays" to read:

    Besides devices, objects are always specified by the combination
    of an EGLDisplay parameter with a parameter representing the
    handle of the object.

Add a new extension type to the list in section "2.8 Extensions"

    Device Extensions
        A *device extension* adds functionality to an individual
        EGLDeviceANGLE.  Different instances of EGLDeviceANGLE may support
        different sets of device extensions

Add a new error to section "3.1 Errors"

    EGL_BAD_DEVICE_ANGLE
        An EGLDeviceANGLE argument does not refer to a valid
        EGLDeviceANGLE.  Any command taking an EGLDeviceANGLE parameter
        may generate this error.

Add a section "3.4 Device Query" after "3.3 EGL Versioning"

    To query attributes of an initialized display, use:

        EGLBoolean eglQueryDisplayAttribANGLE(EGLDisplay dpy,
                                              EGLint name,
                                              EGLAttrib *value);

    On success, EGL_TRUE is returned.  If <name> is EGL_DEVICE_ANGLE,
    the EGLDeviceANGLE associated with <dpy> is returned in <value>.
    All displays have an associated EGLDeviceANGLE, regardless of how
    they were created.  A successful query of EGL_DEVICE_ANGLE will
    never return EGL_NO_DEVICE_ANGLE.

    On failure, EGL_FALSE is returned.  An EGL_NOT_INITIALIZED error
    is generated if EGL is not initialized for <dpy>.  An
    EGL_BAD_ATTRIBUTE error is generated if <name> is not a valid
    value.

    To query the properties of a device, use:

        EGLBoolean eglQueryDeviceAttribANGLE(EGLDeviceANGLE device,
                                             EGLint attribute,
                                             EGLAttrib *value);

    On success, EGL_TRUE is returned and the requested attribute value
    is returned in <value>.  Currently there are no valid values of
    <attribute> defined.

    On failure, EGL_FALSE is returned.  An EGL_BAD_ATTRIBUTE error is
    generated if <attribute> is not a valid attribute.  An
    EGL_BAD_DEVICE_ANGLE error is generated if <device> is not a valid
    EGLDeviceANGLE.

    Because the EGLDeviceANGLE is managed by <dpy>, any calls
    to eglQueryDeviceAttribANGLE with an EGLDEviceANGLE queried
    from a terminated display give undefined results.

Issues

    None.
