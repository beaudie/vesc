    OpenGL ES Extension XX

Dependencies

    OpenGL ES 2.0 is required.

    //This extension is written against the OpenGL ES 2.0 specification,
    the OpenGL ES 3.0 specification, and the OpenGL ES Shading Language 3.0
    specification.

    The presence of the GL_ANGLE_instanced_arrays or GL_EXT_instanced_arrays
    extensions affects the definition of this extension.

Overview

    This extension exposes the *BaseVertex* and *BaseInstance draw call
    variants in EXT_multi_draw_arrays functionality in addition to the vertex shader builtin
    gl_BaseVertex and gl_BaseInstance exposed by ARB_shader_draw_parameters for OpenGL.

    *BaseInstance behaves identically to its counterpart draw calls except that
    instacneCount instances of the range of elements are executed
    and the value of instance advances for each iteration.
    Those attributes that have non-zero values for divisor,
    as specified by VertexAttribDivisor, advance once every divisor instances.
    Additionally, the first element within those instanced vertex attributes
    is specified in baseInstance.

    *BaseVertex* is equivalent to its counterpart draw calls except that
    the value of base vertex passed into driver is baseVertex instead of zero,
    plus that instances of the set of elements are executed and the value of instance
    advances between each set.

    Additionally, gl_BaseVertex and gl_BaseInstance builtins are added
    to the shading language.
    For any *BaseVertex* draw call variant, the baseVertex of the draw may be
    read by the vertex shader as gl_BaseVertex. For non *BaseVertex* calls,
    the value of gl_BaseVertex is 0.
    For any *BaseInstance draw call variant, the baseInstance of the draw may be
    read by the vertex shader as gl_BaseInstance. For non *BaseInstance calls,
    the value of gl_BaseInstance is 0.

Additions to Chapter 10 of the OpenGL ES 3.0 Specification

    Section 10.5 Drawing Commands Using Vertex Arrays:

    The command

    void DrawArraysInstancedBaseInstanceANGLE (GLenum mode,
        GLint first,
        GLsizei count,
        GLsizei instanceCount,
        GLuint baseInstance);
    
    Behaves identically to DrawArraysInstanced except that baseInstance is
    passed down to DrawArraysOneInstanced instead of zero.

    The base index of the instance may be read by
    a vertex shader as <gl_BaseInstance>.

    The command

    void MultiDrawArraysInstancedBaseInstanceANGLE(GLenum mode,
        GLsizei drawCount,
        const GLsizei* counts,
        const GLsizei* instanceCounts,
        const GLint* firsts,
        const GLuint* baseInstances);

    Behaves identically to DrawArraysInstancedBaseInstanceANGLE
    except that a list of arrays is
    specified instead. The number of lists is specified in the drawcount
    parameter. It has the same effect as:

      for(i=0; i<drawcount; i++) {
        if (*(counts+i)>0) DrawArraysInstancedBaseInstance(mode, *(counts+i), *(instanceCounts+i), *(firsts+i), *(baseInstance+i));
      }

    The index of the draw (<i> in the above pseudo-code) may be read by
    a vertex shader as <gl_DrawID>.

    The command

    void DrawElementsInstancedBaseVertexBaseInstanceANGLE (GLenum mode,
        GLsizei count,
        GLenum type,
        const GLvoid* indices,
        GLsizei instanceCount,
        GLint baseVertex,
        GLuint baseInstance);
    
    Behaves identically to DrawElementsInstanced except that baseVertex and baseInstance are
    passed down to DrawElementsOneInstanced instead of zero.

    The base index of the vertex may be read by
    a vertex shader as <gl_BaseVertex>.
    This value is also added to the <gl_VertexID>.

    The base index of the instance may be read by
    a vertex shader as <gl_BaseInstance>.
    Note that this value is not added to the <gl_InstanceID>.

    The command

    void MultiDrawElementsInstancedBaseVertexBaseInstanceANGL(GLenum mode,
        GLenum type,
        GLsizei drawCount,
        const GLsizei* counts,
        const GLsizei* instanceCounts,
        const GLvoid* const* indices,
        const GLint* baseVertices,
        const GLuint* baseInstances);

    Behaves identically to DrawElementsInstancedBaseVertexBaseInstanceANGLE
    except that a list of arrays is
    specified instead. The number of lists is specified in the drawcount
    parameter. It has the same effect as:

      for(i=0; i<drawcount; i++) {
        if (*(counts+i)>0) DrawElementsInstancedBaseVertexBaseInstanceANGLE(mode, *(counts+i), type, *(instanceCounts+i), *(indices+i), *(baseVerteices+i), *(baseInstances+i));
      }

    The index of the draw (<i> in the above pseudo-code) may be read by
    a vertex shader as <gl_DrawID>.

Additions to Chapter 2 of the OpenGL ES 3.0 Specification

    Section 2.9.3 Drawing Commands:

    The command

      void MultiDrawArraysInstancedANGLE(
              GLenum mode,
              const GLint* firsts,
              const GLsizei *counts,
              const GLsizei* instanceCounts,
              GLsizei drawcount)

    Behaves identically to DrawArraysInstanced except that a list of arrays is
    specified instead. The number of lists is specified in the drawcount
    parameter. It has the same effect as:

      for(i=0; i<drawcount; i++) {
        if (*(counts+i)>0) DrawArraysInstanced(mode, *(firsts+i), *(counts+i),
              *(instanceCounts+1));
      }

    The index of the draw (<i> in the above pseudo-code) may be read by
    a vertex shader as <gl_DrawID>.

    The command

      void MultiDrawElementsInstancedANGLE(
                GLenum mode,
                GLsizei* counts,
                GLenum type,
                const GLvoid* const* indices,
                const GLsizei* instanceCounts,
                GLsizei drawcount)

    Behaves identically to DrawElementsInstanced except that a list of arrays is
    specified instead. The number of lists is specified in the drawcount
    parameter. It has the same effect as:

      for(i=0; i<drawcount; i++) {
          if (*(counts+i)>0) {
              DrawElementsInstanced(mode, *(counts+i), type,
                                    *(indices+i), *(instanceCounts+1));
          }
      }

    The index of the draw (<i> in the above pseudo-code) may be read by
    a vertex shader as <gl_DrawID>.

Errors (TODO)

    The error INVALID_VALUE is generated by the new functions if <drawcount>
    is less than 0.

    MultiDrawArraysANGLE, MultiDrawElementsANGLE,
    MultiDrawArraysInstancedANGLE, and MultiDrawElementsInstancedANGLE generate
    the same errors as DrawArrays, DrawElements, DrawArraysInstanced,
    and DrawElementsInstanced, respectively, for any draw <i> where an error
    is generated. If any call would produce an error, no drawing is performed.

Modifications to the OpenGL ES Shading Language Specification, Version 3.00 (TODO)

    Including the following line in a shader can be used to control the
    language featured described in this extension:

      #extension GL_ANGLE_multi_draw : <behavior>

    where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.5.

    A new preprocessor #define is added to the OpenGL ES Shading Language:

      #define GL_ANGLE_multi_draw 1

Dependencies on GL_ANGLE_instanced_arrays (TODO)

    //If GL_ANGLE_instanced_arrays or GL_EXT_instanced_arrays is enabled,
    append the lanuage in "Additions to Chapter 10 of the OpenGL ES 3.0
    Specification, Section 10.5 Drawing Commands using Vertex Arrays" to the language in
    "Additions to Chapter 10 of the OpenGL ES 2.0 Specification, Section
    2.8 Vertex Arrays".

    //If GL_ANGLE_instanced_arrays or GL_EXT_instanced_arrays is not enabled
    and the context is less than a OpenGL ES 3.0 context, the error
    INVALID_OPERATION is generated by any call to the functions
    MultiDrawArraysInstancedANGLE and MultiDrawElementsInstancedANGLE.
