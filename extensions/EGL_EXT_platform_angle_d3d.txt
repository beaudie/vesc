    EGL Extension #68                                                       XXX

Extension Type

    EGL client extension

Dependencies

    Requires EGL_EXT_client_extensions to query its existence without
    a display.

    Requires EGL_EXT_platform_base.

    This extension is written against the wording of version 9 of the
    EGL_EXT_platform_base specification.

Overview

    This extension defines how to create EGL resources from 
    resources using the functions defined by EGL_EXT_platform_base.

New Types

    None

New Procedures and Functions

    None

New Tokens

    Accepted as the <platform> argument of eglGetPlatformDisplayEXT:

        EGL_PLATFORM_ANGLE_D3D_EXT                0x31D9                    XXX

    Accepted as an attribute name in the <attrib_list> argument of
    eglGetPlatformDisplayEXT:

        EGL_PLATFORM_ANGLE_D3D_TYPE_EXT           0x31DA                    XXX

Additions to the EGL Specification

    None.

New Behavior

    To determine if the EGL implementation supports this extension, clients
    should query the EGL_EXTENSIONS string of EGL_NO_DISPLAY.

    To obtain an EGLDisplay backed by a ANGLE D3D display, call
    eglGetPlatformDisplayEXT with <platform> set to
    EGL_PLATFORM_ANGLE_D3D_EXT. The <native_display> parameter is unused and
    should be NULL. If no <attrib_list> is specified, a D3D9 device is
    assumed. Otherwise, the value of EGL_PLATFORM_ANGLE_D3D_TYPE_EXT
    determines the type of backend to use:
      - 0 for D3D9;
      - 1 for D3D11 Hardware;
      - 2 for D3D11 WARP.

Issues
