Number

    EGL Extension ###

Dependencies

    Requires support for EGL_ANDROID_get_frame_timestamps extension.
    Refer to EGL_ANDROID_get_frame_timestamps specification for other
    dependencies.

Overview

    This extension narrows the scope of EGL_ANDROID_get_frame_timestamps and
    only allows for toggling the EGL_TIMESTAMPS_ANDROID attribute of a surface.
    For details about said attribute and other timestamp related terminology
    please refer to the EGL_ANDROID_get_frame_timestamps specification.

    On some platforms (like Android) most of the functionality required by
    EGL_ANDROID_get_frame_timestamps is usually handled by a wrapper outside
    of the driver but it is necessary to be aware of the attribute value on
    some drivers (like ANGLE, which layers GLES APIs over Vulkan, where it
    can cache this information to setup Vulkan swapchains appropriately).

New Types

    None.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.

New Tokens

    None.

For clarity, restating the section of EGL_ANDROID_get_frame_timestamps specification
that will be supported by this extension:

Add to the list of supported tokens for eglSurfaceAttrib in section 3.5.6
"Surface Attributes", page 43:

    If attribute is EGL_TIMESTAMPS_ANDROID, then values specifies whether to
    enable/disable timestamp collection for this surface. A value of EGL_TRUE
    enables timestamp collection, while a value of EGL_FALSE disables it. The
    initial value is false. If surface is not a window surface this has no
    effect.

Issues

    None.
