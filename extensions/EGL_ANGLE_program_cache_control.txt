    EGL Extension #??

Dependencies

    Requires EGL 1.5.

    Written against the EGL 1.5 specification.

Overview

    This extension allows the for creation of an OpenGL or OpenGL ES contexts
    that have access to an internal binary program cache. It also allows for
    querying and populating the contents of the binary cache.

    An OpenGL ES implementation supporting GL_ANGLE_program_cache_control or
    equivalent functionality is required.

New Types

    None

New Procedures and Functions

    void eglGetProgramCacheAttribANGLE(
        EGLDisplay dpy,

        EGLDisplay dpy,

New Tokens

    Accepted as a value for 'attrib' in eglGetProgramCacheAttribANGLE:

        EGL_PROGRAM_CACHE_SIZE_ANGLE       0xXXXX
        EGL_PROGRAM_CACHE_KEY_LENGTH_ANGLE 0xXXXX

    Accepted as an attribute name in the <*attrib_list> argument to
    eglGetPlatformDisplay:

        EGL_DISPLAY_PROGRAM_BINARY_CACHE_MAX_SIZE_ANGLE 0xXXXX

    Accepted as an attribute name in the <*attrib_list> argument to
    eglCreateContext:

        EGL_CONTEXT_PROGRAM_BINARY_CACHE_ENABLED_ANGLE 0xXXXX

Additions to the EGL 1.5 Specification

    Add a new section entitled "OpenGL ES Program Cache Initialization"
    to section 3.2:

    If the attribute EGL_DISPLAY_PROGRAM_BINARY_CACHE_MAX_SIZE_ANGLE is set to a
    positive number, a Display supporting a program binary cache will be
    returned. OpenGL ES contexts created on this display must support the
    ANGLE_program_cache_control extension, or equivalent core API functionality.
    The maximum size, in bytes, of the cache will be set to the value of
    EGL_DISPLAY_PROGRAM_BINARY_CACHE_MAX_SIZE_ANGLE. If
    EGL_DISPLAY_PROGRAM_BINARY_CACHE_MAX_SIZE_ANGLE is zero, program caching is
    disabled. The default value of
    EGL_DISPLAY_PROGRAM_BINARY_CACHE_MAX_SIZE_ANGLE is implementation-dependent.

    Add the following to section 3.7.1 "Creating Rendering Contexts":

    EGL_CONTEXT_PROGRAM_BINARY_CACHE_ENABLED_ANGLE indicates whether the context
    should be created with the GL_PROGRAM_BINARY_CACHE_ENABLE_ANGLE state
    initialized to GL_TRUE or GL_FALSE. The default value of
    EGL_CONTEXT_PROGRAM_BINARY_CACHE_ENABLED_ANGLE is EGL_TRUE. See section 3.13
    for details on the program binary cache.

    Add a section 3.13 to the end of section 3 "EGL Program Binary Cache":

    Each display has an associated program binary cache. This cache stores
    compiled programs for re-use on subsequent calls to glLinkProgram. The
    application can control the behaviour of the cache by enabling or disabling
    its use per-context (see section 3.7.1) and specifying a cache size. It
    can also query the current cache values and populate the cache during start-
    up.

    Program binary cache properties may be queried using

        void eglGetProgramCacheAttribANGLE(EGLDisplay dpy, EGLenum attrib,
            EGLint *value);

    The only accepted values for 'attrib' are EGL_PROGRAM_CACHE_SIZE_ANGLE and
    EGL_PROGRAM_CACHE_KEY_LENGTH_ANGLE. A query for EGL_PROGRAM_CACHE_SIZE_ANGLE
    will return the number of cache entries in the program cache in 'value'. A
    query of EGL_PROGRAM_CACHE_KEY_LENGTH_ANGLE will return the required length
    (in bytes) of the 'key' parameter to eglQueryProgramCacheANGLE and
    eglPopulateProgramCacheANGLE. Any other value for 'attrib' will produce an
    error of EGL_BAD_ATTRIBUTE, and an invalid display for 'dpy' will produce an
    error of EGL_BAD_DISPLAY.

    Cache contents may be queried by using

        void eglQueryProgramCacheANGLE(EGLDisplay dpy, EGLint index,
            void *key, EGLint *keysize, void *binary, EGLint *binarysize);

    If 'dpy' is not a valid display an EGL_BAD_DISPLAY error is generated. If
    'index' is not equal to or greater than zero and less than
    EGL_PROGRAM_CACHE_SIZE_ANGLE, an EGL_BAD_PARAMETER error is generated. If
    'dpy' is not a valid display EGL_BAD_DISPLAY is generated. If 'binarysize'
    and 'keysize' are non-null, and 'binary' and 'key' are null, the size of the
    binary at 'index' is written to 'size', and the key size to 'keysize'. If
    'binary' is not null, 'binarysize' specifies the maximum size of the
    'binary' out parameter, and if 'keysize' is not null, the size of the 'key'
    out parameter. Any attempt to write more than 'binarysize' or 'keysize'
    bytes will produce an EGL_BAD_ACCESS error in this case. If 'keysize' or
    'binarysize' is null, an EGL_BAD_PARAMETER error is generated. If 'key' is
    not null, 'binary' must also be non-null, and vice versa, or an
    EGL_BAD_PARAMETER error is generated. If the cache contents change such that
    a cache entry at 'index' is not retrievable, either EGL_BAD_ACCESS is
    generated or a null key and binary are returned. Valid entries returned are
    not guaranteed to be in the cache. Otherwise, the binary is written to
    'binary' and the program key is written to 'key'.

    The cache may be warmed up on startup with

        void eglPopulateProgramCacheANGLE(EGLDisplay dpy, void *key,
            EGLint keysize, void *binary, EGLint binarysize);

    If 'dpy' is not a valid display an EGL_BAD_DISPLAY error is generated. If
    'binarysize' is negative or greater than an internally defined maximum size,
    EGL_BAD_PARAMETER is generated. If 'keysize' does not match the cache key
    size of the implementation, EGL_BAD_PARAMETER is generated. If the program
    binary is invalid for any reason, behaviour is undefined. Otherwise the
    program will be loaded into the internal binary cache with the key 'key'. If
    'binary' or 'key' are null, an EGL_BAD_PARAMETER error is generated.

    The cache contents may be temporarily released by using

        EGLint eglTrimProgramCacheANGLE(EGLDisplay dpy, EGLint limit);

    If 'dpy' is not a valid display an EGL_BAD_DISPLAY error is generated. If
    limit is negative then EGL_BAD_PARAMETER is generated. In any error case,
    zero is returned, otherwise, the command will free cache resources until the
    total cache size, in bytes, is less than or equal to limit, and return the
    number of bytes of memory released.

Issues

    1. Should the cache control be a property of the display or the contexts?

      The cache itself will internally be a property of the display, since we
      want to share caches between contexts. It is possible to design an
      implementation with other kinds of cache sharing, such as between share
      groups.

      RESOLVED: the cache should be a property of the display.

    2. What should happen if the cache is modified as the user is querying its
       contents?

      It is more difficult to design a query API such that it can be returned
      atomically. Hence the cache can change in some cases while it is being
      queried. This can be controlled in the application layer. It can also be
      locked using OS-level synchronization.

      RESOLVED: we should use a mutex or similar lock to allow for multithreaded
      access, and not expose undefined behaviour.

    3. Should we expose the key/value semantics or just have a binary value?

      Having just the binary would eliminate one query enum, and make the APIs
      simpler. Having both key and value represents the implementation exactly.

      RESOLVED: we should expose the key to mirror the implementation.

    4. Should the extension allow for setting cache size limits?

      If caches are a property of the display, they could be set in
      eglGetPlatformDisplay as an attribute.

      RESOLVED: yes, we should expose cache size controls.
