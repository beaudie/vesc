    EGL Extension #??

    created.

Additions to Chapter 3 of the EGL 1.4 Specification:

    Additions to section 3.5.1 (Creating On-Screen Rendering Surfaces)

    Alter the end of the second paragraph:

        Attributes that can be specified in <attrib_list> include
        EGL_RENDER_BUFFER, EGL_VG_COLORSPACE, EGL_VG_ALPHA_FORMAT,
        EGL_WIDTH and EGL_HEIGHT.

    Add before the last paragraph of section 3.5.1:

        EGL_WIDTH and EGL_HEIGHT specify the pixel width and height of the
        rectangular surface. If neither is set, then the width and height will
        be equal to those of the native window, and the surface will be said to
        be autosizing. If only one of EGL_WIDTH or EGL_HEIGHT is specified then
        an EGL_BAD_PARAMETER error is generated.  If the value specified for
        either of EGL_WIDTH or EGL_HEIGHT is less than one then an
        EGL_BAD_PARAMETER error is generated.

    Additions to section 3.5.6 (Surface Attributes)

    Replace paragraph 16 with:

        Querying EGL_WIDTH and EGL_HEIGHT returns respectively the width and
        height, in pixels, of the surface. For a pixmap surface or autosizing
        window surface, these values are initially equal to the width and height
        of the native window or pixmap with respect to which the surface was
        created. If the native window is resized and the corresponding window
        surface is autosizing, the corresponding window surface will eventually
        be resized by the implementation to match (as discussed in section
        3.9.1). If there is a discrepancy because EGL has not yet resized the
        window surface, the size returned by eglQuerySurface will always be that
        of the EGL surface, not the corresponding native window.

    Additions to section 3.9.1 (Posting to a Window)

    Alter the beginning of paragraph 4:

        If <surface> is autosizing and the native window corresponding to
        <surface> has been resized prior to the swap, <surface> must be resized
        to match.
