    EGL Extension #??

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the wording of the EGL 1.5
    Specification.

    EGL_ANGLE_d3d_texture_client_buffer is required.

Overview

    This extension allows creating EGL surfaces from D3D typeless texture
    objects.

Additions to Chapter 3 of the EGL 1.5 Specification (EGL Functions and Errors)

    Append the following formats to the allowed formats in table
    egl.restrictions (from EGL_ANGLE_d3d_texture_client_buffer):

    DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_TYPELESS
    DXGI_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_TYPELESS

    Append to the fifth paragraph of Section 3.5.3:
    "In addition, in case buftype is EGL_D3D_TEXTURE_ANGLE and the D3D resource
    has a typeless DXGI format, attrib_list may contain the attribute
    EGL_GL_COLORSPACE."

    Replace the last paragraph of Section 3.5.3
    (from EGL_ANGLE_d3d_texture_client_buffer):
    "When a pbuffer is created with type EGL_D3D_TEXTURE_ANGLE, and the
    EGL_GL_COLORSPACE attribute is not specified in attrib_list, the
    EGL_GL_COLORSPACE attribute of the surface is determined by the DXGI format
    of the Direct3D texture. For *_SRGB DXGI formats, the value of
    EGL_GL_COLORSPACE is EGL_GL_COLORSPACE_SRGB. For other formats including
    *_TYPELESS DXGI formats, the value of EGL_GL_COLORSPACE defaults to
    EGL_GL_COLORSPACE_LINEAR."
