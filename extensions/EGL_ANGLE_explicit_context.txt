Status

    Unimplemented Draft

Version

    Version 1, 2018-4-27

Number

    EGL Extension XXX

Extension Type

    EGL Client Extension

Dependencies

    OpenGL ES 3.0 is required.

    EGL_KHR_get_all_proc_addresses is required.

    EGL_EXT_client_extensions is required.

Overview

    This extension adds new GL ES entry points that allow the user to pass the current EGL context
    as a function parameter. This allows users to skip lookup of the thread's current context upon
    entry.

New Types

    typedef void* GLeglContextANGLE

New Procedures and Functions

    For every GL ES entry point available through eglGetProcAddress, an additional entry point is
    made available with "ContextANGLE" appended to the function name, and the parameter
    "GLeglContextANGLE context" inserted as the first function parameter preceding the existing
    parameter list.

New Tokens

    None

Additions to the EGL Specification

    When using GL ES as a client library, the glxContextANGLE entry points allow the user to
    pass the current EGL context as a function parameter to provide better performance than
    looking the current EGL context at every GL entry point.

    Calls to "xContextANGLE" provide no additional validation for the passed context parameter.

    Calls to "xContextANGLE" will generate errors under the same conditions as "x". Any
    instances of undefined behaviour in "x" will also be undefined in "xContextANGLE".

    When an EGL context that is not current is passed into xContextANGLE, the resulting behavior is
    undefined.

Issues

    None.
