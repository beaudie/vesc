    OpenGL ES Extension XX

Dependencies

    OpenGL ES 2.0 is required.

    This extension is written against the OpenGL ES 2.0 specification and
    the OpenGL ES Shading Language 3.0 specification.

Overview

    This extension exposes the Multi* draw call variants in
    EXT_multi_draw_arrays functionality in addition to the vertex shader builtin
    gl_DrawID exposed by ARB_shader_draw_parameters for OpenGL

    These functions behave identically to the standard functions
    DrawArrays() and DrawElements() except they handle multiple lists of
    vertices in one call. Their main purpose is to allow one function call
    to render more than one primitive such as triangle strip, triangle fan,
    etc.

    Additionally, this extension adds a further built-in variable, gl_DrawID
    to the shading language. This variable contains the index of the draw
    currently being processed by a Multi* variant of a drawing command.

    No known IP claims.

New Procedures and Functions

    void MultiDrawArraysANGLE(enum mode,
                              GLint* firsts,
                              GLsizei* counts,
                              GLsizei drawcount);

    void MultiDrawElementsANGLE(enum mode,
                                GLint* counts,
                                GLenum type,
                                GLsizei* offsets,
                                GLsizei drawcount);

New Tokens

    None.

Additions to Chapter 2 of the OpenGL ES 2.0 Specification (OpenGL ES Operation)

    Section 2.8 Vertex Arrays:

    The command

      void MultiDrawArraysANGLE(GLenum mode,
              const GLint* firsts,
              const GLsizei *counts,
              GLsizei drawcount)

    Behaves identically to DrawArrays except that a list of arrays is
    specified instead. The number of lists is specified in the drawcount
    parameter. It has the same effect as:

      for(i=0; i<drawcount; i++) {
        if (*(count+i)>0) DrawArrays(mode, *(first+i), *(count+i));
      }

    The index of the draw (<i> in the above pseudo-code) may be read by
    a vertex shader as <gl_DrawID>

    The command

      void MultiDrawElementsANGLE(GLenum mode,
                GLsizei* counts,
                GLenum type,
                GLsizei* offsets,
                GLsizei drawcount)

    Behaves identically to DrawElements except that a list of arrays is
    specified instead. The number of lists is specified in the drawcount
    parameter. It has the same effect as:

      for(i=0; i<drawcount; i++) {
          if (*(count+i)>0) DrawElements(mode, *(count+i), type,
                (const void*)(long)(*(offsets+i)));
      }

    The index of the draw (<i> in the above pseudo-code) may be read by
    a vertex shader as <gl_DrawID>

Errors

    The error INVALID_VALUE is generated by MultiDrawArraysANGLE and
    MultiDrawElementsANGLE if <drawcount> is less than 0.

    MultiDrawArraysANGLE and MultiDrawElementsANGLE generate the same errors
    as DrawArrays or DrawElements for any draw <i> where DrawArrays or
    DrawElements generates an error.

Modifications to the OpenGL ES Shading Language Specification, Version 3.00

    Including the following line in a shader can be used to control the
    language featured described in this extension:

      #extension GL_ANGLE_multi_draw : <behavior>

    where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.5.

    A new preprocessor #define is added to the OpenGL ES Shading Language:

      #define GL_ANGLE_multi_draw 1
