Status

    Experimental

Version

    Version 1, Dec 10 2015

Number

    EGL Extension #XXX

Extension Type

    EGL display extension

Dependencies

    Requires ANGLE_platform_angle_d3d.

    Written against the wording of EGL 1.4 as modified by
    ANGLE_platform_angle_d3d.

Overview

    This extension exposes an optimized, but potentially non-conformant,
    rendering path for ANGLE's D3D11 renderer on Windows.

New Types

    None

New Procedures and Functions

    None

New Tokens

    Accepted as an attribute name in the <attrib_list> argument of
    eglGetPlatformDisplayEXT:

        EGL_PLATFORM_ANGLE_EXPERIMENTAL_DIRECT_RENDERING      0x33A4

Additions to the EGL Specification

    None.

New Behavior

    To request a display that enables this optimized rendering path,
    the value of EGL_PLATFORM_ANGLE_EXPERIMENTAL_DIRECT_RENDERING should be
    EGL_TRUE.

    If the attribute EGL_PLATFORM_ANGLE_EXPERIMENTAL_DIRECT_RENDERING
    is unspecified then it is implicitly set to EGL_FALSE.

    If EGL_PLATFORM_ANGLE_EXPERIMENTAL_DIRECT_RENDERING is set to EGL_TRUE and
    EGL_PLATFORM_ANGLE_TYPE_ANGLE is not set to
    EGL_PLATFORM_ANGLE_TYPE_D3D11_ANGLE then an EGL_BAD_ATTRIBUTE error is
    generated and EGL_NO_DISPLAY is returned.

Issues

    1) Does enabling EGL_PLATFORM_ANGLE_EXPERIMENTAL_DIRECT_RENDERING
       maintain OpenGL ES conformance?

       RESOLVED: Not necessarily, that is implementation-specific. Check then
       EGL_CONFORMANT attribute to see if the implementation supports any
       conformant EGL configs when
       EGL_PLATFORM_ANGLE_EXPERIMENTAL_DIRECT_RENDERING is enabled.
