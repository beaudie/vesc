Version

Number

    EGL Extension XXX

Extension Type

    EGL client extension

Dependencies

    Requires ANGLE_platform_angle.

Overview

    This extension allows passing the X11 visual ID used by the native
EGL surface types at display creation time. This hint will make the
created display more compatible and potentially more performant when
used with EGLSurfaces created from native types with this visual ID.

New Types

    None

New Procedures and Functions

    None

New Tokens

    Accepted as an attribute name in the <attrib_list> argument of
    eglGetPlatformDisplayEXT:

        EGL_ANGLE_X11_VISUAL_HINT 0x33A3

Additions to the EGL Specification

    None.

New Behavior

    To request a display created with a X11 visual ID hint, the value
of EGL_ANGLE_X11_VISUAL_HINT should be set to a valid X11 visual ID. If
present, this hint will be used during display creation to make a
display that is more compatible and potentially more performant when
used with EGLsurfaces created from native types with this visual ID.
If the visual ID passed isn't a valid visual ID, display creation fails
and an  EGL_NOT_INITIALIZED error is generated.

Issues

    1) When the hint is present, should EGLsurface creation functions
only accept native types with the hint's visual ID?
