Would it be more efficient with dedicated GPU memory to flush cached dirty pages instead?\n\nI actually don\u0027t know how host-visible works with dedicated memory in hardware. Does PCIe get involved? Would every uncached write become a small PCIe message or DMA operation of some sort? That\u0027s the kind of thing I\u0027m curious about here, and I worry uncached writes may be slower with dedicated GPU.",
