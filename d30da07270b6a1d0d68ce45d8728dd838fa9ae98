      "message": "Is this true with both shared and dedicated GPU memory? Would it be more efficient with dedicated GPU memory to flush cached dirty pages instead?\n\nI actually don\u0027t know how host-visible works with dedicated memory in hardware. Does PCIe get involved? Would every uncached write become a small PCIe message or DMA operation of some sort? That\u0027s the kind of thing I\u0027m curious about here, and I worry uncached writes may be slower with dedicated GPU.",

      "message": "so the cache here refers to CPU cache, not GPU cache or a shared cache by CPU/GPU\n\nthe way i look at it is - given that the CPU performs a write-only access to the buffer and that the CPU cache is going to be overwritten by data from other CPU threads, having a cached write will result in cache thrashing. write-through operations can be batched independent of cache related ops",
