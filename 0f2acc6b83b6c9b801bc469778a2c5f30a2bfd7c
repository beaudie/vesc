      "message": "I don\u0027t understand this invert calculation. Say you have a Rect sitting on the x-axis with a height of 10 that gets clipped to a height of 8. Then doesn\u0027t that give a clippedRect.y of 10-8-8 \u003d -6? But it seems like inverted clipped rect of on x-axis w/ a height 8 should have clippedRect.y of -8.\n\nI suspect that I\u0027m missing something as this appear to be passing testing. If my confusion is obvious, perhaps a comment that could help dispel it?",
