      "message": "Maybe there\u0027s a more generic fix possible here. The key here is that it\u0027s _enabled_ but invalid. What if we make the rest of the code think that it\u0027s _not_ enabled when invalid?\n\nLike, we maintain a mask of enabled vertex attributes, we can also maintain a mask of valid vertex attributes. Then `\u0026` them together before iterating over enabled vertex attributes. The code just needs to make sure it uses some `getEnabledAttributes()` helper that does the `\u0026`.",

      "message": "We could track the validity of each attribute based on whether it has a null pointer and whether is bound to a buffer (and other factors?). In that case, should each backend ignore updating it if it is not enabled and valid (e.g., in `syncDirtyAttrib()`)? Or do you mean using it would be skipped in `updateStreamedAttribs()` if invalid?",

      "message": "The criteria for invalid can be as limited as we want, because we only have evidence that nullptr is a problem in apps, right? So yes, just limiting to nullptr/not-bound-to-any-buffer should be sufficient to work around this problem.\n\nIn terms of what to do with it, I haven\u0027t looked deeply into all the places that need to be touched, but perhaps its sufficient to just pretend (everywhere) that invalid attribs are !enabled?",
