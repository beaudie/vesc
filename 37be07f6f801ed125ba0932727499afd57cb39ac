      "message": "Thanks a lot for the fixes! It looks like you\u0027ve fixed more than one bug, are more tests necessary? The d3d skip removals are for PBO tests, which can take a different path in the Vulkan backend, probably the equivalent non-PBO test would have failed on Vulkan too (your new test seems to duplicate one of those tests, but not the other)",
