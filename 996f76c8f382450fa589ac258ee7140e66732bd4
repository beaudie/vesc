In that case, basically most of the change would need to be reverted.\n\nAlso, please add tests similar to what was added in that change, but for ESSl1: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/829138/3/src/tests/compiler_tests/ShaderValidation_test.cpp\n\nI have a feeling that change was made to allow for common but non-conformant applications to run, despite having non-constant globals. If so, this change could cause regressions. With Olli gone, I don\u0027t know how we can figure that out (maybe the reviewers can remember the reason).",
