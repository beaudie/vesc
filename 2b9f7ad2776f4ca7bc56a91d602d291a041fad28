      "message": "This is a rather urgent fix for Fuchsia, so I apologize for the lack of extensive testing. Charlie\u0027s work in this area will either make this obsolete or shed more lights on its effect on performance. I can verify that this makes the Manhattan trace free buffers 5 extra times (during loading, and no more), and doesn\u0027t affect T-Rex.\n\nDavid, I believe both 16MB allocations should now be gone with this, but I\u0027d appreciate it if you would confirm.",
