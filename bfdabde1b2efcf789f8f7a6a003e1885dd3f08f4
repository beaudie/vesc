      "message": "The new test ensures that the validation layer is consistent across various compressed format extensions in the context of enabled/disabled state.\n\nThe new Metal limitation affects only systems older than 10.15. I think it\u0027s a better approach than disallowing 3D uploads of BPTC textures altogether.\n\nThe Qualcomm failure is documented here: https://crbug.com/1060012. I\u0027ll try to add a workaround for that or just skip the failing case on that platform.\n\n ",
