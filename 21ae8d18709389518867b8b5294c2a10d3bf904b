      "message": "@Quyen, does metal support specialization constants? If not, changing specialization constants to normal constants in SPIR-V is really trivial. I can help you / provide a SPIR-V transformation for this (if necessary), but will you be willing to make the metal backend also deal with flipping the same way the Vulkan backend is doing now?\n\nI would really like to see the two backends unified here so we can clean this code up further.",

But I probably won’t make any changes to ANGLE in near future fyi. Wanting to take a break.\n\nMaybe someone else could do it in the mean time.",

      "message": "Right now Metal reuse a lot of stuffs from TranslatorVulkan. So if there are significant behavior changes in the vulkan translator, the metal backend must be updated also. I understand it would be a pain some times.\n\nOne possible way is just making TranslatorMetal a copy of TranslatorVulkan. That way if there is breaking change in vulkan it won’t affect metal, though there would be duplicated code.\n\nIdeal method is creating Metal translator from scratch, translating directly to metal shader (bypassing spirv code). That would a giant task tbh.",
