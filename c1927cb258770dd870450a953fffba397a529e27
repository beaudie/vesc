      "message": "One suggestion here. Could we make these tests run a separate test step for each glmark2 scene? This will help run them with perf_test_runner.py to reduce variance. Even internally here we could decide to run a scene three times and take the mean.\n\nTwo ways of implementing this. The easiest is to make N TEST_P() tests. Each with a scene. The more fancy way is to use testing::Combine to combine the list of platform configs with a list of scenes. Either seems fine to me. I think we should hard-code the list of scenes for now.\n\nScene list produced when running glmark2 with \"-l\":\n[Scene] buffer\n[Scene] build\n[Scene] bump\n[Scene] clear\n[Scene] conditionals\n[Scene] desktop\n[Scene] effect2d\n[Scene] function\n[Scene] ideas\n[Scene] jellyfish\n[Scene] loop\n[Scene] pulsar\n[Scene] refract\n[Scene] shading\n[Scene] shadow\n[Scene] terrain\n[Scene] texture",
