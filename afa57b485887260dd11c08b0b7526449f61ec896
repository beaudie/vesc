      "message": "At least for me the replay exe changes to the new directory, and with the path to the executable pre-pended to the library name the library can\u0027t be found. \n\nI\u0027ve changed the patch to try to load the library first with ApplicationDir and if that fails, try SystemDir. I had o refactor the PosixLibrary a bit to not create an instance on failure. I didn\u0027t want to do a check on getNative(), this seems to me like breaking  the encapsulation.",

      "message": "It fixes for me that I can run multiple tests in one go, currently I get an error as described in the given issue 5849, I debugged it, and for some reason the replay executable runs in the ReplayN directory, so that prepending the path to the library name makes loading the the replay library fail. TBH I have no idea why it would fail locally and pass remotely, because I have no additional patches applied that would change something there. It could be only some configuration that is not stored in git that borks my setup.",
