      "message": "top_level_array_stride is platform dependent for non-standard layout type. So you can see in [a],  mGetMemberInfo (all members in sh::BlockMemberInfo are platform dependent) will be called in back end not front end. But if you compute mTopLevelArrayStride here, how should I process the non-standard layout? You can see that patch set 7 did as you suggested (the trybots failing is because \u0027blocklayoutHLSL\u0027 is only linked for d3d ).",
