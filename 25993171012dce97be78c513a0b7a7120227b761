We should even be able to log a call trace with ANGLE_TRACE_EVENT in multiple threads though that might take a bit more plumbing.",

      "message": "Actually, this should be /vulkan, not /vulkan_null.\n\nI tried with VTune and can see the work gets split between two cores. Unfortunately thoughput doesn\u0027t go up. Might be being limited by another factor. Since it takes load off of one core though, it should improve CPU bound scenarios.",
