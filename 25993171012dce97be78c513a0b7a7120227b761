We should even be able to log a call trace with ANGLE_TRACE_EVENT in multiple threads though that might take a bit more plumbing.",

Might be being limited by another factor. Since it takes load off of one core though, it should improve CPU bound scenarios.",

Wanted to get a baseline in that works and at least has similar perf and work from there.",
