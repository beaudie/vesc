I\u0027m getting the following compile errors when trying to build the resulting trace:\n\n    disney_tsum_tsum_capture_context3.cpp:2:10: fatal error: \u0027trace_fixture.h\u0027 file not found\n    #include \"trace_fixture.h\"\n             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis leads to a bunch of other errors.\n\nI\u0027m okay with the tracer being broken for a single commit, but only if the follow up that fixes it is ready to land.",
