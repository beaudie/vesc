      "message": "Indeed, as I suspected there are some failures. Luckily they should be easy to fix.\n\nFirst, look at Constants.h, see where `IMPLEMENTATION_MAX_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BINDINGS` is defined. You can add a similar comment to that for `IMPLEMENTATION_MAX_COMBINED_SHADER_UNIFORM_BUFFERS` and change the value to 36 (EXT_geometry_shader requires 36 as the minimum value).\n\nSecond, make sure to add a `IMPLEMENTATION_MAX_GEOMETRY_SHADER_UNIFORM_BUFFERS` (16 should be fine?) and limit `mState.mCaps.maxShaderUniformBlocks[ShaderType::Geometry]` here too.\n\nYou can try to run the tests locally to verify that these fix the failures. Let me know if you need help running tests.",
