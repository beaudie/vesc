What I suggest is you make use the DrawElementsPerfParams class to have new parameters that test the following:\n\na) DrawElements with an unchanging buffer every frame\nb) DrawElements with a buffer that changes every frame\nc) (optional) DrawElements with a client-side pointer\n\nfor b) (and optionally c)), initialize two arrays in setup and use those to reset the buffer data so it changes every frame, but there is no allocation done in the test body.",
