      "message": "I did your idea initially but I wasn\u0027t crazy about how it turned out. It didn\u0027t look very nice to pass a TextureVk to the pixel buffer functions. And then pass nullptr from RenderbufferVk. And check the pointer for nullptr before flagging dirty. So I opted for this design since it\u0027s consistent with dirty bits. If you guys both hate it I can change it back. But given this is how dirty bits work I\u0027m okay with it. There might be a clever alternative I didn\u0027t think of.",
