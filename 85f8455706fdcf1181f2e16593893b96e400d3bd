I\u0027m convinced that this works right now because `sizeof(*Params) % 4 \u003d\u003d 0` for all the params structs above. If you feel up to it, you can add such `static_assert`s for every param too.\n\nNow that I look closer, some of the params structs could be rearranged to avoid padding.\n\nJust to be clear, I\u0027m not blocking submission on this, just something for the future.",
