      "message": "This is crashing chromium in runtime with libstdc++, if it is built with rtti (as in Ubuntu at least). The problem is because it will internally use dynamic_cast. \n\nEven if it has a guard for only going through dynamic cast if libstdc++ is built rtti, chrome angle is built without rtti and that will still crash as even though libstdc++ is built with rtti, the inherited class MemoryAllocationLogNumberFormaat is not built with rtti.\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/49939459/c-locale-without-rtti comments about the problem.\n\nQuestion is how to workaround this. Not sure if it is possible to only add RTTI to the types inheriting from std::locale RTTI, or build full ANGLE with rtti.",
