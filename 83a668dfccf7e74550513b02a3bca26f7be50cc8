You can `find` examples around in the codebase.\n\nOtherwise no objection to caching the encoders, or using threads.

      "message": "So my original idea was to re-home these files into ANGLE (ie: they would be first party to ANGLE, not third party). AstcCpuDecompressor.h would be a public ANGLE header, so that gfxstream can use this code (since we have a dependency on ANGLE). \n\ngfxstream would no longer keep a copy of AstcCpuDecompressor.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nOtherwise, if we put them into ANGLE\u0027s third_party, then we have to keep them as first party to gfxstream, any any fixes that we do there needs to be manually propagated over to ANGLE, with the risk of code divergence.\n\n\u003e You\u0027d probably want to add a \"feature\" though (as in include/platform/frontend_features.json) to choose between threaded or not, just in case.\n\nSounds good. I\u0027m thinking of exposing the thread count as a feature. Currently it\u0027s hard coded, but obviously we will want to adjust it. If thread_count \u003d\u003d 1, then we can have a special paths to not use any worker threads.",

      "message": "It depends I guess on how much you could consider this ANGLE code. If the license at the top says AOSP, then it\u0027s third party. If you change the license to be ANGLE\u0027s, then you probably need to ask the original author if you could do that. If this was originally gfxstream\u0027s code and you are donating it, then sure you could do that :)\n\nThat said, stuff in third_party/ aren\u0027t necessarily git repos pointing elsewhere. For example see how the files in src/libANGLE/renderer/vulkan/shaders/src/third_party/etc_decoder are copies that have been modified by ANGLE.\n\n---\n\nAbout features, unfortunately our features are currently just bool. I think that works ok for now, just have enabled / disabled, and leave it to the pool to decide the thread count based on the system configuration.",
