      "message": "This test fails on native GL and GLES due to not being able to find a suitable EGL config.\nIt works on Vulkan/SwS where it reproduces the capture/replay issue fixed by the formatutils patch.\n\nI am not able to skip the test on native GL before it fails, as skipping cannot be done before initializing the config. Therefore I am abandoning this patch for upstreaming.",
