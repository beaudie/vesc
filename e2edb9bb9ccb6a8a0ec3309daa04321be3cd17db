      "message": "Is this expected to ship or is it just for testing? It\u0027s not particularly big, but it does add ~50KB of binary size to an Android build (which is particularly redundant, as Android vendors support ASTC).\n\nAlso, looks like the decoding is buggy. For example look at the GOLD failure for war_planet_online, especially the foliage looks very blurry.\n",

      "message": "I noticed some of the diffs (including war_planet_online) almost looked like a different LOD was selected.  I approved them since it was comparing against a different platform and weren\u0027t glaringly bad.  We\u0027ve always had minor differences when textures are involved.\n\nLubosz, I can un-approve the blurry images if you\u0027d like to look closer at them.\n\nI think the real world intent is for this to be for testing, but I don\u0027t think we\u0027re blocking it anywhere.  Only including it for platforms that need it is interesting, especially to reduce binary size.",
