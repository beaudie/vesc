It\u0027s not particularly big, but it does add ~50KB of binary size to an Android build (which is particularly redundant, as Android vendors support ASTC).\n\nAlso, looks like the decoding is buggy. For example look at the GOLD failure for war_planet_online, especially the foliage looks very blurry.\n",

I approved them since it was comparing against a different platform and weren\u0027t glaringly bad.  We\u0027ve always had minor differences when textures are involved.\n\nLubosz, I can un-approve the blurry images if you\u0027d like to look closer at them.\n\nI think the real world intent is for this to be for testing, but I don\u0027t think we\u0027re blocking it anywhere.

The other profile would be relevant if we also exposed `GL_KHR_texture_compression_astc_hdr`.\n\nI chose `ASTCENC_PRE_MEDIUM` quality as it was the default used in the library\u0027s example code. Benchmarking against `ASTCENC_PRE_FASTEST` only gave a performance gain of `0.575s` when loading up the `war_planet_online` trace.\n\nLooking into the library the quality option is also mostly related to encoding, I am not sure it is actually used during decoding. SwiftShader has a modified version of the library with encoding stripped out, and does not have the notion of quality profiles at all.\n\nFor performance on Debug builds, it turns out that setting `-02` for only the `astc-encoder` library is enough to cut down loading times significantly.\nIn the benchmark I am using the `time` command with `--max-steps-performed 1` to time the full duration of the load up. So it contains the performance impact of loading up the shaders as well, compared to release builds.\n\nMy suggestion is to append `-O2` when building angle with `is_debug \u003d true`.\n\nFull benchmarks:\n\n```\ntime ./out/Debug/angle_perftests --gtest_filter\u003dTracePerfTest.Run/vulkan_war_planet_online --max-steps-performed 1\n```\n\n```\n2m36.226s No optimizations\n2m36.568s Thread count set to 24 (using a 24 thread CPU)\n2m35.651s ASTCENC_PRE_FASTEST profile\n2m25.026s SSE4.1 (ASTCENC_SSE\u003d1 and -msse4.1)\n2m12.339s SSE 4.1 and link time optimization (ASTCENC_SSE\u003d1 and -msse4.1 -flto)\n0m42.648s -O2 on only `astc-encoder`\n0m42.255s -O3 on only `astc-encoder`\n0m 6.518s Release build\n```",
