True?\n\nIs/should there be any interaction with RenderTargetVk::mContentDefined (which also affects the loadOp, like this CL does)?",

      "message": "Disabling the depth test OR the mask makes depth not writable in GL. So yes on the first question.\n\nGood question on ContentDefined. I don\u0027t know if there\u0027s an interaction which could affect performance. The correctness tests seem OK. We chatted offline a bit about ContentDefined - it would be nice if we could figure out a way to track this such that the RP has access to it on end().",
