I don\u0027t think this workaround will even affect other platforms (if it did, VANGLE would have been crashing at init on that platform. It only makes a difference in combination with the -Oz -fno-common options).\n\nRe: bots, I\u0027d definitely like to get them. I think we can get some devices from Fuchsia team, but need to figure out how we can bring up and manage them.",
