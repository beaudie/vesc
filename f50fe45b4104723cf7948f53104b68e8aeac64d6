      "message": "The reason for the most failures here is that `ProgramGL::linkJobImpl` uses API location/index assignments when either parameter is not present and the extension is supported. This has been confirmed with the OpenGL ES WG to be incorrect because:\n- API calls cannot override location and index statically set in GLSL.\n- When location is set without index, the latter is implicitly set to 0, i.e., `layout(location\u003d0)` is the same as `layout(location\u003d0, index\u003d0)`.\n\nWe should probably enforce `ProgramOutput::pod::index` to be zero when it is not 1 and remove `outputVar.pod.index \u003d\u003d -1` checks from that function.",
