How do OpenGL games run at all on mac+intel?\n\nGoing through the thread on bugs.webkit, and looking at https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1912790/ this bug shouldn\u0027t be affecting newer drivers.\n\nSince the Chromium workaround was added by intel, it\u0027s sound to add the workaround to ANGLE too, but I wonder if the issue is really something else (because you observe it on newer drivers too), and that the flushes are just masking some other (possibly synchronization) problem.",
