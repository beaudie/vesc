      "message": "\u003e Wow. How do OpenGL games run at all on mac+intel?\n\nGood question. It\u0027s likely that games aren\u0027t making the same kinds of graphics calls that browsers (and the conformance suite) do.\n\n\u003e Going through the thread on bugs.webkit, and looking at https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1912790/ this bug shouldn\u0027t be affecting newer drivers.\n\u003e \n\u003e Since the Chromium workaround was added by intel, it\u0027s sound to add the workaround to ANGLE too, but I wonder if the issue is really something else (because you observe it on newer drivers too), and that the flushes are just masking some other (possibly synchronization) problem.\n\nThanks for this feedback. You\u0027re right - I was able to reduce the test case further into small JavaScript and native tests. Flushing before/after glBindFramebuffer doesn\u0027t work around the problem in the native test, although for some strange reason it does in the reduced JavaScript test.\n\nGoing to iterate further on this workaround.",
