      "message": "I thought the original intention is to partition the global lock into multiple lock domains, one of which is surface lock. Should we do the opposite: Keep the ANGLE_SCOPED_GLOBAL_SURFACE_LOCK and remove ANGLE_SCOPED_GLOBAL_LOCK here (and do similar fix for https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/4316610 as well which leads to this CL). What do you think? Otherwise, there will still potential lock contention that when someone doing a bit lengthy work while holding global lock, surface operation will still get blocked, and lock partition was intended to avoid that.",
