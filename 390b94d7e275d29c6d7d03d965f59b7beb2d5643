      "message": "I don\u0027t think this can/will get changed in Android.  Here\u0027s my rationale.\n\n1) It would break compatibilty.  Any change would break any Vulkan application that is already using VK_KHR_incremental_present with pre-rotation.  Any change would create future compatibility problems for new apps that want to run on multiple Android releases (e.g. Android n rotates the rects, Android n+1 does not).\n\n2) The rotation is done in generic platform code (that doesn\u0027t know about Vulkan vs. GLES, but was written for GLES before we ever joined Google).  The only way I can see to \"fix\" this is to rotate the rectangles in the Vulkan loader (then there would be 3 rotations), but then we\u0027re back to the compatibility issue.\n\nThus, I\u0027m inclined to say we have to live with this.\n\nI should get the Vulkan spec clarified.",

      "message": "Based on the amount of time you spent on finding and fixing this (good job by the way), I agree with Cody that we should have an Android/Khronos bug to make a formal decision on what to do here.   If this doesn\u0027t end up being fixed in Android (whether due to a spec clarification or for legacy support), it should at least be used to document this unexpected behavior somewhere.   It would be nice to not bury this landmine for the next vulkan app developer to step on.\n\nIs there precedent for not fixing bugs like this in order to preserve backwards compatibility?   What happens if a CTS/dEQP test is created to expose the bad behavior (is there one already)?\n\nDoes eglSwapBuffersWithDamageKHR() have any visibility into what VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR.preTransform is set to?   Would it be possible for it to at least detect the bad behavior and log things to try and save other developers\u0027 time?",
