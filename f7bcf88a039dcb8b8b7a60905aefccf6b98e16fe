Xcode 14 deprecated sprintf(), so I\u0027m trying to get iOS (and macOS) to compile again.\n\n(In addition to these, there are a handful of sprintf() calls in angle dependencies, including spirv-tools and ceval. I\u0027m assuming those will need to be patched upstream and rolled into angle.)\n\nThanks!",
