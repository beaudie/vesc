      "message": "We could potentially do the FS pre-rotation stuff in SPIR-V too, and remove the spec constants for that. That should work around the QC bug with constants, and simply other bits too (like remove a handful of translator transformations). In many cases applying the pre-rotation in SPIR-V is as simple as changing the Op (like OpDPDx to OpDPDy) maybe followed by an OpFNegate, or reordering the parameters (again, maybe after an OpFNegate).\n\nOther than as a workaround to the driver bug, not really a big deal though.",
