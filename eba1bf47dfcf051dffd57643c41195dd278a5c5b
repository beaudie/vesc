      "message": "After some digging, looks like using System.setOut() isn\u0027t supposed to affect C++ side.\nSorry for the false lead.\n\nThe only other idea that I have is to reproduce this locally and debug Bionic\u0027s libc to figure out why sometimes we own fd 1 and sometimes not.\nPerhaps, as Peter suggested, fd 1 is not being properly released by a previous invocation of the same Activity.\nI don\u0027t think we can close fd 1 in our code to fix that, though - it may be used by other parts of the system.\nMaybe we can force the activity to terminate in the catapult/devil code.",
