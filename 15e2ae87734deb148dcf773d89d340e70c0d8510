      "message": "I\u0027m not too happy about having to store 64-bit integers here. I wonder if we can come up with a better alternative? I can think of at least:\n\n1) Store blit dimensions in a different data structure than Rectangle, and use Rectangle just for viewport/scissor. ClipRectangle logic has to be duplicated.\n2) Store all Rectangles as sets of x0, x1, y0, y1 and provide member functions for returning width/height as int64_t, casting it back to int32_t when needed.\n3) Store width/height as uint32_t. Then cast it back to signed whenever it is known to be less than max signed int32_t, and cast to int64_t when it may be more than max signed int32_t. This requires quite carefully written code.\n\nAll of these seem to have some drawback or another.",
