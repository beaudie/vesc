      "message": "My worry is that this may becomes a bit fragile when people use it wrong way in the future. How about keep it with different ImageHelper (and possibly turn it into a strong reference if needed) but have it point to an dummy VkImage which gets updated at later time with a real swapchain image? That way you an assert if dummy vkImage is been actually referenced when it should not and mean time all other state is still maintained properly.",
