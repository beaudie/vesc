The redGreen values are quite large floating point numbers, so are these based on these values getting interpolated over many pixels? I can\u0027t get the math to add up with these numbers.\n\nWould be good to have these calculated based on the 110/115/120/125 constants set above, so it\u0027s clear how they are derived.",
