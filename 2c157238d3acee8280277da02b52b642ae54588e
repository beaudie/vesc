      "message": "Ultimately, I think we need to use VkPresentMode: VK_PRESENT_MODE_SHARED_CONTINUOUS_REFRESH_KHR for this feature of EGL to work.\nANGLE does not support, and probably not Android.\n\nVK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE_KHR - still requires a vkQueuePresent.\nas does VK_PRESENT_MODE_SHARED_DEMAND_REFRESH_KHR - and a queueBuffer.\n\n VK_PRESENT_MODE_SHARED_CONTINUOUS_REFRESH_KHR should not require a queueBuffer(), but may require some form of flush to process draw commands?\n \n So I am thinking we can not support eglCreateWindowSurface with EGL_RENDER_BUFFER \u003d\u003d EGL_SINGLE_BUFFER. There is no error, so we can fail silently and be in FIFO mode. The app must query EGL_RENDER_BUFFER to see if it actually worked. So we can keep that part. But basically a silent fail for ANGLE.\n \n Does that seem right to everyone?",
