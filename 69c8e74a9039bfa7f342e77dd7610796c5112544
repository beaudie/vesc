      "message": "The switch to ES3 uncovered an AST transformation (InitializeVariables) that looks up globals in the symbol table by name. So when we rewrote fragment out/inout variables to specify `location`, this would fail.\n\nI don\u0027t know what the preferred resolution would be, but for now, this is a proof of concept that shows the issue is understood and solvable.",

      "message": "So `InitializeVariables` already skips the `inout` PLS variables.\n\nThe problem here is when a shader has a single output, `out vec4 color`, and this transformation has to rewrite it to `layout(location \u003d 0) out vec4 color` (since after we add outputs, `location` becomes required on that original output). In this case, I think `InitializeVariables` can\u0027t skip that output, right? (Unless we take care of initializing it here.)",

      "message": "That\u0027s not ideal, but a reasonable workaround. So to recap:\n\n- Init the variable during transformation, if `InitializeVariables` was necessary\n- Skip init in `InitializeVariables` for that variable.\n\n---\n\nThe real fix IMO is to have `InitializeVariables` iterate on the declarations itself, instead of using the collected (and possibly transformed) `ShaderVariable`s, that\u0027s a recipe for bugs like this.\n\nYour alternative solution is to make sure the PLS transformations are done _after_ `InitializeVariables`. Would that work?",
