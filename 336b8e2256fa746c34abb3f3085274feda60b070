      "message": "The `AtomicRefCounted` is currently used in `WarmUpGraphicsTask` and requires `memory_order_acq_rel` for porbper synchronization.\n\nI noticed that `memory_order_acq_rel` was added for `RefCountedEvent`, but then reverted. However, this problem existed before adding the `RefCountedEvent`, so we indeed need to change the memory order.",

      "message": "I\u0027ve seen relaxed ++ and acq_rel -- for ref counts elsewhere too, but I thought this is the way it is because `AtomicRefCounted` is always protected by the sharegroup lock ... which now that I think about it doesn\u0027t make sense (as it otherwise wouldn\u0027t have needed atomic).\n\nAnyway, leaving to Charlie for the proper review as he was fiddling with this recently,",

      "message": "++ relaxed is always OK.\n\nCode that uses relaxed -- is also OK, as long as `isReferenced()` is not used to check if object may be updated/destroyed without additional synchronization.\n\nFor example, in case of `RefCountedDescriptorSetLayout`, ++ may be used from a worker thread, while -- from the context thread, therefore we need atomic operations. But we do need acq_rel -- in that case, because objects are destroyed with the  `DescriptorSetLayoutCache`, and by this time, all async task must be finished and Programs destroyed, so it is safe to `ASSERT(!layout.isReferenced())`.",
