      "message": "The `AtomicRefCounted` is currently used in `WarmUpGraphicsTask` and requires `memory_order_acq_rel` for porbper synchronization.\n\nI noticed that `memory_order_acq_rel` was added for `RefCountedEvent`, but then reverted. However, this problem existed before adding the `RefCountedEvent`, so we indeed need to change the memory order.",

      "message": "I\u0027ve seen relaxed ++ and acq_rel -- for ref counts elsewhere too, but I thought this is the way it is because `AtomicRefCounted` is always protected by the sharegroup lock ... which now that I think about it doesn\u0027t make sense (as it otherwise wouldn\u0027t have needed atomic).\n\nAnyway, leaving to Charlie for the proper review as he was fiddling with this recently,",
