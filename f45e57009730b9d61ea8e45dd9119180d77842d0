      "message": "Hey Lubosz, thanks for getting this started quickly.\n\nCan you minimally squash \"Generators: Use fixed ...\" and \"Refresh generated files...\" \n\nThe pre-commit commit verifiers will fail on the first patch and we won\u0027t be able to land them separately. You should be able to test these out using Commit-Queue +1.\n\nAlso when you set \"Ready for Review\" please add your two reviewers. For now we can always pick myself and Cody for you guys.",
