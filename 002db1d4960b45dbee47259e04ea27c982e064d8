      "message": "I\u0027m confused about why setting to max() here vs. 0 as is done before the loop and below when setting barrier.\nI\u0027m thinking it\u0027s to make sure any follow-on subresources that hit \"else\" case below are guaranteed to overlap and set their own barrier. However, if that happens, the first follow-on subresource will cause this flag to get set to 0 so resources after that would no longer hit the overlap case.\nIs there a hole here?",
