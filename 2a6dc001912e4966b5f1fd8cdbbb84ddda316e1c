I am concerned about adding the renderer to the texturevk object, and some of the data accesses/locations of the helper routines, but please consider this an experimental approach.  AGI captures will show the texture name in the Textures tab as well as when selecting a DescriptorSet View on the pipeline-\u003eFS page.",
