      "message": "Looking at where `getEquationColorIndexed` is used, most of the code would benefit from getting the ANGLE enum instead of the GL enum out of that function.\n\nInstead of this, I highly recommend changing the return value of `getEquationColorIndexed` to be the ANGLE enum, and adjust the call sites accordingly. In a couple places, their GL enum based `switch`es can become ANGLE enum based. In other places you can call the ToGL call explicitly.",
