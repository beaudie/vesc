      "message": "There\u0027s a race condition introduced by this removal. `glGetProgramBinary` is used with `nullptr` once to get the length, and again to get the binary. If the post-link task finishes in between, the application sees the binary length has changed.  Applications may not be able to handle that. Besides, a program binary that doesn\u0027t include the warmup is fairly useless.\n\nI understand if you want to remove this wait, and that\u0027s fair. Implementing anglebug.com/7393 would fix this race condition _and_ let you remove the wait.",

      "message": "im not sure i see it, looks like `Program::serialize(...)` is called irrespective of whether we are querying length or the blob itself. That eventually ends up in `ProgramExecutableVk::save` which does have the call to wait for post-link tasks, there should be no race. This gives the backends the option to choose whether they want to take the hit of a stall and save the vulkan pipeline or just skip saving it\n\n\u003e a program binary that doesn\u0027t include the warmup is fairly useless\n\nthis actually depends on many other factors, including but not limited to, the caching policy of Vulkan ICD",

      "message": "just realized you might be talking about non-vulkan backends that have post-link tasks (maybe the WIP webgpu backend?)\n\nWe could expand `ProgramExecutableImpl::waitForPostLinkTasks(...)` to take in `gl::Command`? Then the front end can have these waits all over the place but the backend can be selective about which wait it will actually honor?",
