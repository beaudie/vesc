      "message": "There\u0027s a race condition introduced by this removal. `glGetProgramBinary` is used with `nullptr` once to get the length, and again to get the binary. If the post-link task finishes in between, the application sees the binary length has changed.  Applications may not be able to handle that. Besides, a program binary that doesn\u0027t include the warmup is fairly useless.\n\nI understand if you want to remove this wait, and that\u0027s fair. Implementing anglebug.com/7393 would fix this race condition _and_ let you remove the wait.",
