Honestly I think it would be a better API contract if ANGLE tests always emitted an empty test results file when we read the --isolated-test-output command line argument, rather that the calling harness having to know that ANGLE doesn\u0027t write an output file specifically for --list-tests (layering violation, etc). LGTM in any case.",
