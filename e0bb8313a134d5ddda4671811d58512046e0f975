Honestly I think it would be a better API contract if ANGLE tests always emitted an empty test results file when we read the --isolated-test-output command line argument, rather that the calling harness having to know that ANGLE doesn\u0027t write an output file specifically for --list-tests (layering violation, etc).

      "message": "\u003e Does this fix anything?\n\nIt reduces risk of swallowing an error when called without `--list-tests`. We want missing file to blow up the runner in that case, not just silently fail.\n\n\u003e it would be a better API contract if ANGLE tests always emitted an empty test results file\n\nAgree but I think it is orthogonal to this change. If we can do this then we can drop the special handling of `--list-tests` (but runner should still be blowing up if the file is missing or cannot be read for whatever reason)",
