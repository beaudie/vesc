      "message": "Yeah, it\u0027s kind of convoluted. I ran into mysterious crashes when trying to change this line:\nhttps://crsrc.org/c/third_party/angle/src/tests/perf_tests/TracePerfTest.cpp;drc\u003d54e08a5af1f7ca50d5c154a09cc056166a9e49fa;l\u003d2143\nbecause TracePerfTest(const T\u0026) captures T by reference which is uncommon, making it easy to shoot yourself in the foot.\n\nThis happened as I was trying to make json failures more reasonable. Given that I abandoned that path (as noted on https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/3690734/comments/0824a7c8_70098f7e), it becomes just a code health improvement just to avoid someone else running into the same issue in future. But I\u0027m also fine with just leaving it be if this cl looks like a weird way to do it.",
