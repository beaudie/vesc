It\u0027s a quick hack of the EGLContextSharingTest.DeleteReaderOfSharedTexture test.\n\nIt did NOT fail on Windows when I removed your fix.\n\nIt DID fail on Android/Pixel 4 XL when I removed your fix (on a 1+-week old version of ANGLE that had my instrumentation and your fix).\n\nIt did NOT fail on the same device when I removed my instrumentation and your fix.  Without my instrumentation, I\u0027m not sure why it didn\u0027t fail.",
