This feels really awkward, unless the previous variable names were horrifically wrong.\n\nI suspect that Extents is being used because it provides a convenient 3-element value that approximates the needs of the functions, but I would much rather see an explicit \"Offset\" struct be created for this use to prevent confusion.",
