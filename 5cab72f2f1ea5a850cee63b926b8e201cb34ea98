Can use the essl1_shaders::fs::Checkered() shader to make sure flip is working.\nThe blit/resolve stuff can be found in BlitFramebufferANGLETest.cpp\nThe copy tex image stuff can be found in CopyTexImageTest.cpp",

The others make sure resolve works with either src or dst flipped.\n\n---\n\nAlso, could you please make sure the blits are not full-size?
