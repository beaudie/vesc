What\u0027s the distinction? What is an AttachmentSubResource? I understsand that this change makes more of the code common, but the mResource/mSubResource split in FramebufferAttachment.h/cpp is confusing.",

      "message": "Whoops, I forgot to update this to class when I made it use access control, thanks, will fix.\n\nI\u0027ll try another name. The SubResource terminology is a D3D concept, maybe why it seems unfamiliar. A SubResource indexes a part of a resource, such as a texture mip, or in this case, Depth vs Color from a Surface attachment. The AttachableResource is the whole resource.",
