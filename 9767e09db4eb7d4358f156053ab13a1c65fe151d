      "message": "Hi Jonah, thanks for pointing out how to get the number of color attachments. The upper bound was added so that we\u0027re only calling framebufferTexture2D for color attachments although I realize I didn\u0027t grab a good upper bound to begin with. \n\nThat being said, do you know if we\u0027d need to worry about what attachments are valid in calls to framebufferTexture2D depending on the OpenGL/ES version we\u0027re using? Looking through the docs I see that in OpenGL es2.0 for example, the only valid attachments are GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0, GL_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT, or GL_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT. Looks like we could generate a GL_INVALID_ENUM error if we tried to unbind an invalid attachment. I\u0027m not sure what versions are currently supported though so I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s an issue.\n\nAdding onto this, I\u0027m not sure if the original driver error we\u0027re working around is generated on a DEPTH or STENCIL attachment, it\u0027s possible we want to unbind those as well. Vasily, do you think we\u0027d hit the error there? I can get a build together to check if needed.",
