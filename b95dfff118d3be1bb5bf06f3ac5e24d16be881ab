      "message": "My previous concern was: the multisample test are enabled to cover the tests required by Khronos Conformance Package. If we do not need to submit Khronos Conformance Package for ANGLE on Win/Linux, we can consider skipping them on win/Linux to save test infra resource. But if we have customers who use ANGLE on Linux/Win (battelstar, chrome?), I guess it is worth enabling the multisample tests on these platforms to improve the ANGLE code quality on them, too,",

      "message": "+1 to enabling on Linux, at least with SwiftShader. First of all, it would help to tell if a test is just broken, or only failing on Android. Also Linux/SwiftShader uses GCEs which I understand are both cheaper and easier to deal with. FWIW, dEQP runs are very fast, and this is a subset of the tests, it\u0027s probably ok to enable them on windows too.",
