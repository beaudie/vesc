Maybe we could build up some type of capabilities requirements list like \u0027mExtensionPrerequisites\u0027 (with a corresponding areExtensionPrerequisitesFulfilled()) to be as fine-grained as possible on where the tests are skipped.   Then it\u0027s not really a \"bug\" that the test is skipped (and no TODO either), but just the requirements of the trace.",
