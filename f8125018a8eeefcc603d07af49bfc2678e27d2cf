      "message": "this is true -- however, on the GL back-end, there might be a driver difference in the implementation of glDrawRangeElements vs glDrawElements. OTOH we might always want to call DrawRangeElements when we have an index range. I think the right approach might be to add a new impl method for drawRangeElements to simplify the GL back-end. Geoff any thoughts?",
