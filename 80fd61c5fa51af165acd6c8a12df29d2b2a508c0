I have one suggestion:\n\nInstead of making a separate name/display_name, display the name as the camelCaseName, and accept both under_score_name and camelCaseName when doing any string name interpretation. That way we can support the Chromium use case and have a consistent implementation, where we don\u0027t have to mentally track which back-end uses what naming scheme. With auto-gen this becomes easy to implement.\n\nYou can do this as a follow-up if you prefer.",
