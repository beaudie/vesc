      "message": "This needs to be moved to `visitFunctionPrototype`. In the example of the test, that always gets called before `visitFunctionDefinition` so that works. But that would also support something like this:\n\n```\nstruct Foo { ... } foo();\nmain() {\n    ...\n    Foo f \u003d ...\n    ...\n}\nFoo foo() { ... }\n```\n\nPlease add that as a test too, to make sure the transformation can handle that.",
