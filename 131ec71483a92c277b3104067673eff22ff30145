      "message": "I see the condition that defines ANGLE_ENABLE_ASSERTS is `!defined(NDEBUG) || defined(ANGLE_ENABLE_RELEASE_ASSERTS)`. The latter comes from `dcheck_always_on`, but I\u0027m not entirely sure if NDEBUG comes exactly from !is_debug (looks like chromium\u0027s build/config/BUILD.gn enables this in the \"release\" target, but I didn\u0027t look further into what exactly uses release).\n\nAll that rambling to say, I wish there was a gn way to dictate this and `ANGLE_ENABLE_ASSERTS` with the same expression. One option is to move ANGLE_ENABLE_ASSERTS\u0027s definition out of the header and move it to gn.\n\n---\n\nI\u0027m fine with this as is too, worst-case scenario someone will complain about a compile error and we\u0027ll fix it.",
