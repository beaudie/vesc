Triple-buffering allows us to present an image,\n    //   have one in the queue and record in another.  Note: on certain configurations (windows +\n    //   nvidia + windowed mode), we could get away with a smaller number.\n    //\n    // For simplicity, we always allocate at least three images.\n\n    mMinImageCount \u003d std::max(3u, mSurfaceCaps.minImageCount);\n\nThis way, only immediate mode is affected, allocating one extra image. I think we can agree that\u0027s not a big concern.\n\nFeel free to improve the comment.",
