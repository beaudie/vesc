We should allow access to this function whether it\u0027s exposed via the extension, or it\u0027s just core in ES3.1 (double check that)\n\nBut we need to validate the parameter GL_FRAMEBUFFER_FLIP_Y_MESA, which is only exposed with the extension.\n\nIn fact, this could potentially be your issue, since there need to be changes to ValidateFramebufferParameteri to allow the call through with the Flip Y parameter.",
