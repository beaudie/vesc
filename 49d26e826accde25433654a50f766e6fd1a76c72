      "message": "I\u0027d be curious to follow up with this. Generally if it works on a driver, ANGLE will have to subsume this functionality. e.g. ANGLE has to emulate the behaviour of the existing driver, including making undefined defined. So I think this workaround would extend to any app that has this call pattern.\n\nI wonder if it\u0027s a specific case where we invalidate pixels that are cleared, and never read in a shader.\n\nAnyway it\u0027ll be good to follow up with this even if you land a temporary iteration. I\u0027d also recommend you extend the behaviour to the invalidateSub call below for consistency.",
