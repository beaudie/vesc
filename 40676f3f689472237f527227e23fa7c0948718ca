      "message": "I don\u0027t think this will work. It relies on angle_deqp_gtest.cpp being rebuilt with a different #define for the two different targets. Consider the case where those two targets are being built simultaneously; the generation of the .obj file, and linking, will race.\n\nThe best way to resolve this would be to have two top-level .cpp files, one for the ES2 and one for the ES3 tests.",
