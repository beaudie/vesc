IIUC, if there are no calls to SwapBuffers, this will continue toggling between two buffers inappropriately.\n\nThis can be avoided by implementing\n\n- canDrawInCGLContext:pixelFormat:forLayerTime:displayTime:\n\nThat callback will be called by the system, and if you return YES, you will be asked to draw a frame and if you return NO, you won\u0027t.\n\nIf there has been a call to SwapBuffers, then make the next call to canDrawInCGLContext return YES and do the std::swap of the buffer pointers there.",
