      "message": "the new test is a catch all for any bug in counting mechanism, not specifically tailored to this corner case. The fix here was about 2 things -\n\n1. to not increment when a slot is bound with a new buffer replacing an old one. with the old code the count would have been 2 but with this change the count will be 1. either way the offset calculation will be performed.\n\n2. to decrement when we rebind a slot with null buffer. with old code the count would be 1 but with new code the count will be 0. Though there is a difference, it will not affect anything since when we go into \"writeAtomicCounterBufferDriverUniformOffsets\" all we do is see that the bindings are invalid and silently exit the function.\n\ndo you have a specific bind/unbind pattern that can trigger the bug this patch fixes?",
