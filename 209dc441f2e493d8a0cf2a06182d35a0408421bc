Like that would have worked nicely if we merged multiple changes from a branch all at once, but since we run CI on every single commit, it becomes expensive.\n\nSo definite yes to making commits as small as possible to encompass one logical change, but it\u0027s best to keep all the related changes to that one logical change in a single commit.",
