      "message": "I thought of that too, it would be good to have `compare_goldens.sh` specifically (as it\u0027s rather large) as an actual file the tree. It could have argv which would be passed via a templated wrapper. This way changes to it can be easily tested by running the script locally without having to go through the bundler. But this isn\u0027t really a blocker for this CL, current state is fine IMO for its purpose and we can improve later. That\u0027s why I\u0027m only suggesting to drop the `gn_dir` arg",
