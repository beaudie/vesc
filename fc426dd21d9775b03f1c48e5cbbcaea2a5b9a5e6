      "message": "@Austin, after this change you can remove the egl::Display from CLPlatformVk and create a RendererVk directly. Just need to derive `CLPlatformVk` from `vk::GlobalOps`. Implementation of all the functions can remain empty for now until you have a use for them (at which point you can start adding a worker pool to `CLPlatform`, deal with device loss etc).",
