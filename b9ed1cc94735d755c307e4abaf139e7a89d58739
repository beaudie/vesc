      "message": "I\u0027m having a hard time reasoning about the correctness of this change. Will the command encoders always be used with stack discipline? I\u0027m thinking about a scenario where the previous render encoder is ended before the blit or compute encoder is.\n\nWould it be more obviously correct if the active encoder were split up into two fields - an active render encoder, and an active blit or compute encoder?",
