      "message": "It looks to me like this value is somewhat correlated to the number of contexts, except when a context hasn\u0027t yet compiled a shader or something.\n\nGiven that contexts are made to do actual rendering, isn\u0027t it true that gActiveCompilers becomes \u003e 0 pretty early in the program and gets back to 0 pretty much at the end? Why not have the Display call sh::Initialize and sh::Finalize on initialize() and terminate() respectively and remove this global altogether?\n\nAlternatively, the Display could maintain this and call sh::Initialize when mContextSet becomes non-empty() and sh::Finalize when it becomes empty().\n\n---\n\nOr is the cost of sh::Initialize so much that it has to be deferred and moved out of (Chrome) startup?",

      "message": "Currently we don\u0027t initialize the compiler for contexts that don\u0027t compile shaders. There\u0027s some small risk that there\u0027s a use case for creating the compiler lazily out there somewhere. If we initialize the compiler at \"compile\" time, there\u0027s no way to avoid a mutex. If we want to change where the compiler is initialized, can we do that in a separate CL and just quickly land these SAN fixes?",
