      "message": "Sounds good :)\n\nFor a test, I looked at `ImageTestES3.RGBXAHBImportThenUpload` as a base. The idea was to add a texture update after `ClearEmulatedChannels`, copy it to FBO and see that the update has not been applied. However, the updates get flushed once after `glFramebufferTexture2D()` (extra update not flushed) and once when reading pixels (extra update flushed).\n\nI also tried copying the texture to another texture (via `glCopyImageSubData()`), but it failed due to format incompatibility.\n\nIs there another way we can try to detect that the update is not flushed?",

Looking at `RGBXAHBImportThenUpload`, it looks like that test should have actually caught the bug.\n\nOh, did you mean `glTexSubImage2D` does the flush? Because of `applyUpdate` in `TextureVk::setSubImageImpl`?\n\nOk, it\u0027s not ideal that we rely on that implementation detail to catch the bug, but I don\u0027t see a reliable way around it.",

      "message": "Sorry. `glFramebufferTexture2D()` was from an earlier local draft based on another test (`RGBXAHBImportThenClear`), in which it actually *does not* cause the flush (`glClear()` does).\n\nFor `RGBXAHBImportThenUpload`, the flush indeed happens during `glTexSubImage2D()`, after which the image upload would not be applied without the fix. However, later during verification, it would be flushed during the `drawQuad()` call.\n\nIn addition, even if the verification part is removed, the test would pass even without flushing the remaining update if `eglDestroyImageKHR()` is called in the end. The buffer block assertion hits if `eglDestroyImageKHR()` is removed as well.",
