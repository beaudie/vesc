      "message": "Sounds good :)\n\nFor a test, I looked at `ImageTestES3.RGBXAHBImportThenUpload` as a base. The idea was to add a texture update after `ClearEmulatedChannels`, copy it to FBO and see that the update has not been applied. However, the updates get flushed once after `glFramebufferTexture2D()` (extra update not flushed) and once when reading pixels (extra update flushed).\n\nI also tried copying the texture to another texture (via `glCopyImageSubData()`), but it failed due to format incompatibility.\n\nIs there another way we can try to detect that the update is not flushed?",
