Hard to tell how it may impact real-World performance.\n\nIn any case. If I reverted real fix it should be applied separately and not with an actual bug fix.",

      "message": "Actually, I think that `ImageLayout::Present` needs extra execution dependency for the layout transition operation itself:\n\nhttps://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/wiki/Synchronization-Examples#combined-graphicspresent-queue\nhttps://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Drawing/Rendering_and_presentation\n\nAs I understand this, we need to have a dependency chain from acquire semaphore. For this chain to happen, *source stage* in the barrier should match stages in the `pWaitSemaphores` which are stages where image may be accessed.\n\nCurrently we use only `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT` stage.\nHowever swapchain image is also accessed by `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TRANSFER_BIT`.\nThe G996B has tearing because of the wrong barrier if only do full screen clears with random color. I plan to push the fix.\n\nSo after the above fix need to add:\n`VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT | VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TRANSFER_BIT`\nto the *source stages* for `ImageLayout::Present` barrier.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not sure this is correct. The layout transition itself is a write operation (e.g. it could decompress the image) which needs to synchronize with the previous operations. Does this synchronize correctly?\n\n- Color write\n- Barrier Color-\u003eBottom, transition Color-\u003ePresent: decompress the image\n- Present\n\nThe present itself is synchronized with semaphore right, and memory barrier is automatic. But it seems to me that the layout transition barrier should be Color-\u003eTop, so decompression happens after Color (-\u003eBottom doesn\u0027t synchronize it)",
