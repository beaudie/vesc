      "message": "I think we can drop this check if you feel like it\u0027s less work overall to implement GLES 2.0 support as a part of the initial patches rather than separately. Can you also include a change to the spec in this patch that removes the GLES 3.0 requirement? You can say in the spec text:\n\n\"This extension is written against the OpenGL ES 3.0 specification.\n\nOpenGL ES 2.0 is required.\"\n\nAnd maybe add a paragraph that says that the layered functionality is not available on GLES 2.0.",

      "message": "The side-by-side rendering is not intended to be exposed to WebGL directly, but just through an opaque framebuffer that abstracts the side-by-side rendering. Overlapping viewports shouldn\u0027t trigger any unsafe behavior either. Either way it can\u0027t be validated at this level, since we only know the offsets here and not the viewport state that will be used to draw, it needs to be draw time validation if we want to validate it.",
