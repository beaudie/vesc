My current suspicion is that the error is thrown by opening the file, not by closing the stdout stream.\n\nIf the error is caused by opening the file, our life is a lot easier than if it is caused by closing the stdout stream.\n\nI will try to symbolize the stacktrace once I get a new Chrome checkout (related to why I was contacting techstop)\n\nIt looks like System#setOut() is the way to do the stdout redirection in Java according to https://www.dev2qa.com/how-to-write-console-output-to-text-file-in-java/ I will test whether this redirection works for C++ called from Java",
