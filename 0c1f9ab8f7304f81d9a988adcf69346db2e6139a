      "message": "\u003e Is it possible to add an end2end test for this in some form?\n\nduring its tear down end2end test suite cleans up properly so the callback becomes a noop.\n\nWhile looking into adding tests i hit upon a corner case -\n\n Thread A - eglGetProcAddress(...) (increases refCount to 1)\n    The thread\u0027s setProcessCleanupDisplay(...) never gets called so display is nullptr\n Thread B - eglMakeCurrent(...) (increases refCount to 2)\n    The thread\u0027s setProcessCleanupDisplay(...) does get called and a valid display is set\n    \n ...\n\n Thread B gets destroyed without cleaning up (decreases refCount to 1)\n    since refCount is not 0 nothing happens\n Thread A gets destroyed without cleaning up (decreases refCount to 0)\n    refCount is 0 but getProcessCleanupDisplay() returns nullptr and so it does nothing\n    \nand we end up leaking memory\n    \nI need to move away from relying on a display being set because the thread is \"active\" to getting access to the set of already created displays so all threads have the ability to cleanup irrespective of the order in which they are destroyed",
