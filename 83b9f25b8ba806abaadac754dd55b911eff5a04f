To be safe I updated this change to keep the new feature disabled, which ensures that it won\u0027t block roll to chromium. I will enabled it in chromium separately.",

I don\u0027t like that it\u0027ll make an inconsistent behaviour between ANGLE in Chrome and in standalone. If you\u0027re just worried about breaking a bot, can you instead run your tryjob in Chromium against this ANGLE CL by specifying the ref for this CL as ANGLE\u0027s DEP?",
