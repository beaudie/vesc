      "message": "Just think of the case where shaderVersion is 310. Now what happens if this condition would be \"shaderVersion !\u003d 300\"?\n\nFirst \"level\" is \"ESSL3_1_BUILTINS\". So the code checks table[ESSL3_1_BUILTINS] on the first iteration of the for loop. On the second iteration it comes to this if statement with \"level\" being \"ESSL3_BUILTINS\". shaderVersion !\u003d 300 is true, so \"level\" is decremented to \"ESSL1_BUILTINS\". The result is that table[ESSL3_BUILTINS] is not checked.\n\nIf the condition is \"shaderVersion \u003c 300\", table[ESSL3_BUILTINS] is checked as it should be.\n\nThe switch statement version was also wrong, though actually in a different way - I didn\u0027t notice earlier that there weren\u0027t breaks. ESSL1_BUILTINS need to be skipped in case version !\u003d 100, they are exclusive to only that shader version.",
