      "message": "This could use some improvement. Say the texture has the following levels:\n\n- Level 0: 4x4\n- Level 1: 2x2\n- Level 2: 1x1\n\nNow if the max level is 1000 or 200 or 400 or 10, it doesn\u0027t make any difference. There may be need to add a helper to determine the maximum possible number of levels (or maybe can use `getMipLevelCount(ImageMipLevels::FullMipChain)`). Then if both current and previous max levels are above that (that + base that is), you could consider it not changed. Otherwise if one is within the max possible range, you could use the `previous !\u003d current` check. Basically the right-hand side of the above \u0026\u0026 just needs changing.\n\nAlso, there\u0027s a bug here as is. If `previousMaxLevel \u003d\u003d gl::kInitialMaxLevel`, then `maxLevelChanged` becomes false, but that\u0027s not correct. In the above example, if maxLevel goes from 1000 to 0, you shouldn\u0027t just ignore that.",
