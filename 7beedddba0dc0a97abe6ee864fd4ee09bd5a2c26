This would require switching away from the system-level assert macro and doing a different preprocessor check here. See https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/wtf/Assertions.h\u0026l\u003d49 for an example of how the dcheck_always_on\u003d1 GYP_DEFINE takes effect in Blink.",
