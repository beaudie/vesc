      "message": "That\u0027s the resolution the benchmark was running when the capture was taken, which I think we\u0027ve all been defaulting to.  Interesting question though:  What resolution do we want to run at, and does it need to be the same on all platforms?  It is tempting to try recording at the native resolution of Android, but it differs between devices.  I\u0027m going to try recording at 1080p, see how that looks.  I also need to figure out a way to set the rotation for Android in the perf test harness.",
