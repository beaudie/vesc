Please help to check if these own a correct behavior. \n1, To track the image layout transition, use the \u0027mRenderPassImagesWithLayoutTransition\u0027, which record the *read image needed layout transition* and all of the write image. This make a distinguish with the exist *mRenderPassUsedImages*, which makes a confuse close renderpass for the read GL_texture without layout transition.\n\n2, based on the item1, use new interface *endRenderPassIfComputeAccessAfterGraphicsTextureImageAccess* to unify the GL_Texture read or write by framebuffer attachment write, and all the GL_image write/read, and replace the interface *endRenderPassIfComputeReadAfterAttachmentWrite*.",
