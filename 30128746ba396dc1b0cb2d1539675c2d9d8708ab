      "message": "This will close the render pass, so the optimization in this change won\u0027t take effect. You would need to create the two-attachment FBO first, then draw into both at the same time.\n\nSee MultisampledRenderToTextureES3Test.ColorAttachments0And3 for inspiration, like what shaders to use. So the test would go:\n\n- Create FBO1 with two attachment\n- Draw into both attachment with one draw call (one red, one green)\n- ReadBuffer(0)\n- Resolve into FBO 2\n- ReadBUffer(1)\n- Resolve into FBO 3\n- Readbacks and verifications\n\nUntil \"Readbacks and verifications\", there should be nothing that can break the renderpass.\n\nCurrently, the first resolve force-closes the render pass (which is why the test would pass), but it technically didn\u0027t have to.",
