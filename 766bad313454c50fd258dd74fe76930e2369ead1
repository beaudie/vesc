      "message": "How does the test fail if gl_FragColor is not assigned to here?\n\nI\u0027m also thinking that there might be another bug in the output - a shader is not supposed to statically assign both gl_FragColor and gl_FragData. But that\u0027s probably something to fix in another patch.",

      "message": "The earlier test was not correct. It should be gl_FragColor which is being assigned to.\nWhenever the GL_EXT_draw_buffers extension is enabled, the gl_FragColor value should be replaced by a broadcast to all color attachments. Basically:\n\nReplace\n\ngl_FragColor \u003d something\n\nby\n\ngl_FragData[0] \u003d something\ngl_FragData[1] \u003d gl_FragData[0]\netc...\n\nI thought it would be good to have the test because the AST gets modified by adding new initializers for gl_FragData.",

      "message": "In that case I don\u0027t think that this test belongs here. These tests should be specifically testing that output variables get initialized when needed, not that gl_FragColor writes are broadcast. There\u0027s already EmulateGLFragColorBroadcast_test. It seems like if the shader didn\u0027t originally statically refer to gl_FragColor/FragData, no initialization is added by ANGLE either.",
