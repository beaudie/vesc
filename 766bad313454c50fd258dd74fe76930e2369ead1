      "message": "How does the test fail if gl_FragColor is not assigned to here?\n\nI\u0027m also thinking that there might be another bug in the output - a shader is not supposed to statically assign both gl_FragColor and gl_FragData. But that\u0027s probably something to fix in another patch.",

      "message": "The earlier test was not correct. It should be gl_FragColor which is being assigned to.\nWhenever the GL_EXT_draw_buffers extension is enabled, the gl_FragColor value should be replaced by a broadcast to all color attachments. Basically:\n\nReplace\n\ngl_FragColor \u003d something\n\nby\n\ngl_FragData[0] \u003d something\ngl_FragData[1] \u003d gl_FragData[0]\netc...\n\nI thought it would be good to have the test because the AST gets modified by adding new initializers for gl_FragData.",
