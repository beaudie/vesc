      "message": "geoff, these are negative tests and the tests passed after you made the change only because half float was an invalid enum. With the addition of half float, we are back to the problem where deqp is not checking for extensions if the context is 2.0 and not a backwards compatible 3.0 context.\n\ndeqp still needs a fix or at the least, we need to disable these tests until ANGLE can expose a backwards compatible 3.0 context by default",

      "message": "I debugged it again because it was bugging me.  Turns out the difference was that our other backends are returning backwards compatible contexts while Vulkan is not so I didn\u0027t fully catch the issue in the last CL.  I modified this CL with and additional check for HALF_FLOAT_OES + rgb/rgba that requires ES3 for them to be renderable which matches the dEQP test: \n\nextensions that would make format color-renderable:\n  GLES3 compatible context, GL_EXT_color_buffer_half_float and GL_OES_texture_half_float\n\nGoing to run the tryjobs on it.",
