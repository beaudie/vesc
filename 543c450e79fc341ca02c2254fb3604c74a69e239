      "message": "It looks like more of the same to me, a gradient that is dropping off, getting slightly larger or smaller based on a boundary condition.  I would approve them.  They are probably slightly non-determinstic on those edges.  Approving the new one should allow either result to pass, if I understand how Skia Gold manages goldens (a growing set, not eliminating the old result).",

      "message": "I\u0027ve seen that on Pixel 4, where the next couple of traces in alphabetical order will get slightly different results.  Might be a matter of teardown between them, like you said, state leakage.  The wordscapes and zombie_smasher kind of mess up that pattern though.\n\nYuly, would it make sense to turn on Pixel 6 devices for CLs that land new traces, to force the author to review and approve them?  I do it locally (inspecting with diffs and such), but I always forget when landing them.",
