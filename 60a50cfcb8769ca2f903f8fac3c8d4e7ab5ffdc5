      "message": "The part setting `dstAccessMask` is redundant. `GetBasicLayoutAccessFlags` already sets the same access masks being added.\n\nThe part setting `srcAccessMask` is either redundant or unnecessary. HOST_WRITE_BIT is set already if `mCurrentLayout` is PREINITIALIZED, and is unnecessary if image is in any other layout. TRANSFER_WRITE_BIT should also be unnecessary as either `mCurrentLayout` is TRANSFER_DST_OPTIMAL (meaning `GetBaskicLayoutAccessFlags` already sets this bit) or if not, there\u0027s no need for this bit.\n\nNote also that `newLayout \u003d\u003d VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL` was never exercised since `GetBasicLayoutAccessFlags` would have hit `UNREACHABLE()`.\n\nI\u0027ll split it.",
