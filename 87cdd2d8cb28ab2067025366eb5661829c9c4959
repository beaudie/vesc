      "message": "I didn\u0027t merge them because IsInternal takes different parameters from Valid (Valid takes a context). I like how Valid takes a context, and IsInternal is called from places where we don\u0027t have access to the Context (inside renderer guts). I was thinking how we manage access to Context stuff might change with Geoff\u0027s refactor so I left it as-is, but I\u0027m not adverse to just taking the clientVersion, provided we change the other ValidX functions to take a clientVersion as well. (Sorry for the long-winded answer).",
