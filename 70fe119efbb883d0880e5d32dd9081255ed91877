      "message": "Hm, this looks a little awkward.   In one case you set the dependencies and then recordCommands(), but in the other it\u0027s the opposite ordering.   It looks like this is because of the finishCurrentCommands() call within onSelfReadWrite(), which recordCommands() could also do if the right conditions are met.\n\nDo we expect that finishCurrentCommands() could be missed so it\u0027s required within onSelfReadWrite().   Or, with finishCurrentCommands() inside onSelfReadWrite(), could multiple finishCurrentCommands() could be performed?",

      "message": "The current graph API _is_ awkward. Setting global memory barriers always prepends the barrier to whatever node is current (with no regards to whether that\u0027s correct). `recordCommands` is oblivious to memory barrier.",
