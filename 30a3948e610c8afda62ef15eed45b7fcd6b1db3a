      "message": "No, this is not a bug fix. The stride was only used as cache key before. 0 just means tightly packed, so should still work properly (since we also have the formatId as the key as well which makes key still unique). But I am going to use stride cached in the cache key directly in the later CL, so I want to pass in the actual stride here. Both are correct.",
