      "message": "I\u0027m a bit confused by this comment.   Why do we want to know how many can run without glFinish() if we are running with glFinish()?\n\nPresumably the glFinish() will wait for all of the work to complete that might be missed without a glFinish(), so how does running without glFinish() give us a time that\u0027s representative of how long running with glFinish() will take?",

      "message": "So this is what we did before:\n\nstep()\nglFinish()\nstep()\nglFinish()\n.. repeat for \"gCalibrationTime\" seconds\nthen take the number of steps, the actual time ran, and compute an estimate of steps \"mStepsToRun\". \n\nwhen we run for real, we go\n\nstep()\nstep()\nstep()\n.. repeat for \"mStepsToRun\" steps.\nglFinish()\n\nthis has an obvious performance difference, because after each step() (one frame in a trace) you had a complete stall.\n\nWhat the new code does, is first it does the above to compute a tentative steps to  run, then does another pass (several times) where it then computes the \"actual\" elapsed time after running mStepsToRun and then re-computes mStepsToRun. This produces a much more accurate approximation of the number of steps to run in the fixed time.\n\nThe goal is as always more consistency and stable measurements using the same number of steps when we take many samples.\n\nI can try to encapsulate this in the comment if it would help.",
