      "message": "I need your help with this one Mohan. The change should be functionally correct, but as you can see adds a bit of complexity everywhere. It saves on buffer allocation and garbage collection, which should show on applications that frequently modify UBOs (basically anything from the past decade).\n\nWhat I don\u0027t know is whether the saving amounts to anything significant CPU-wise. Would you please give this change a spin and see if you see gains anywhere? If there are no gains, I\u0027d prefer not to submit it.\n\nAlso Jamie, this should have synergy with your descriptor cache work, so maybe you can try them together to see if this helps your change show some speed up.",

      "message": "While this CL is showing a problem with our current buffer implementation, it also seems to be showing how fragile this code is, since it\u0027s still easy to miss adding the offset when doing something with a BufferVk.   I\u0027m not sure what the answer is, but it would be nicer if this was handled more automatically rather than all of the manual offset addition that\u0027s being done.   That may be unavoidable while BufferVk has both a BufferHelper and a DynamicBuffer without the caller knowing which is being used so they have to assume there are suballocations and an offset must be accounted for.\n\nIt also looks like there are several bug fixes in general in this CL, which none of the current testing has caught.   Besides Mohan\u0027s test that may be added later, is there anything else you can add now to show this CL is cleaning things up correctly?",

Many things have been \"fixed\" because they didn\u0027t work with a non-zero offset, but we didn\u0027t have non-zero offsets before this change.\n\n\u003e Besides Mohan\u0027s test that may be added later, is there anything else you can add now to show this CL is cleaning things up correctly?\n\nI landed a large number of tests I developed as part of this change, but I split off and landed them already.
