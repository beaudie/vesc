From the test, the \"FS sample + CS image load\" is one renderpass which is as expected. But when handling the last \"FS something\", a new renderpass starts caused by the *DIRTY_BIT_RENDER_PASS* setting by previous. Seems it is affect by other factors. But the result of \"FS sample + CS image load\" in this test already verify this patch\u0027s motivation.",

      "message": "Thanks for the explanation. Could you please put `ComputeShaderTest/DrawDispatchImageReadDraw` back? I realize its redundant with the perf counter test, but instead it runs on other backends as well (while the perf tests only run on Vulkan).\n\nFor `VulkanPerformanceCounterTest_ES31/DrawDispatchImageReadDrawWithoutEndRP`, IIRC, we realized it\u0027s a limitation of the current design that the render pass breaks, so it\u0027s good to have the test there, with a comment that it needs optimization (otherwise it can be easily forgotten), so would you please add that last bit of it back?",
