      "message": "Sorry for forget comment these modified tests.\n1, remove *VulkanPerformanceCounterTest_ES31/TextureSampleByDrawDispatchDraw*:\nthis case will be update at new CL by VVL error with bug: http://anglebug.com/7031\n2, remove *ComputeShaderTest/DrawDispatchImageReadDraw*:\nit is the same with *VulkanPerformanceCounterTest_ES31/DrawDispatchImageReadDrawWithEndRP*, for the latter it also can verify the renderpass counter. so keep the latter and remove the former.\n3, modify *VulkanPerformanceCounterTest_ES31/DrawDispatchImageReadDrawWithoutEndRP*:\nThe origin api sequence for this test is FS sample + CS image load + FS something else after glReadPixels. From the test, the \"FS sample + CS image load\" is one renderpass which is as expected. But when handling the last \"FS something\", a new renderpass starts caused by the *DIRTY_BIT_RENDER_PASS* setting by previous. Seems it is affect by other factors. But the result of \"FS sample + CS image load\" in this test already verify this patch\u0027s motivation.",
