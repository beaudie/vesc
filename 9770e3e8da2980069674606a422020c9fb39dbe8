      "message": "WebKit still uses hand-maintained Xcode projects to determine which files are compiled from ANGLE and other third-party libraries. There isn\u0027t a good interposition point in WebKit\u0027s Tools/Scripts/update-angle to filter out only certain .cpp files from directories like src/compiler/translator/tree_ops/gl/.\n\nThere likely won\u0027t be many additional changes in these directories, and since this will streamline collaboration with Apple, lgtm.\n\nKimmo, if Shabi\u0027s suggestion works for WebKit or you find another less-intrusive alternative in the future, I trust you\u0027ll revisit this.",
