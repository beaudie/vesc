      "message": "I\u0027m guessing this is because of this?\n\n    // The max vertex output components should not include gl_Position.\n    // The gles2.0 section 2.10 states that \"gl_Position is not a varying variable and does\n    // not count against this limit.\", but the Vulkan spec has no such mention in its Built-in\n    // vars section. It is implicit that we need to actually reserve it for Vulkan in that case.\n    GLint reservedVaryingVectorCount \u003d 1;\n\nI was actually wondering about it. The comment says gl_Position doesn\u0027t count towards varyings, but does it say anything about gl_PointSize? Maybe that also shouldn\u0027t count towards varyings? Will you please take a look at the spec?",
