      "message": "Overall LGTM. My gut feeling is that with this, code gets a bit more ugly and complicate in some places just that we can get rid of context\u0027s list. My personal preference is to keep context\u0027s list for things that aren\u0027t obvious/straight forward. But I am also okay with what you have here. I will let others comment here.",
