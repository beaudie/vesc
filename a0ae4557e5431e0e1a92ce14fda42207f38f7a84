      "message": "This is a replica of a dEQP test that was failing on ARM for a similar reason. We had a lot of back and forth with ARM about it, and in the end we had to force fp16 for mediump through OpQuantizeToF16. Try enabling the `explicitlyCastMediumpFloatTo16Bit` feature to see if that fixes the test.\n\nFor context, see this change: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/4400404\n\nFeel free to contact Nvidia about it; like I said, this is a duplicate of a dEQP test, I\u0027d love to know if Nvidia has better arguments about why they are failing this check.",
