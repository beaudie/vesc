      "message": "This changes the logic of how rules are applied for devices with multiple GPUs.\nThis will be very confusing if answer is different for different GPUs.\nI wanted to suggest this in my original review, but didn\u0027t want to burden you too much - in my opinion the subobjects used by Rules and Scenarios should be different. So, the new ScenarioDevice class should have a single ScenarioGPU instead of list of GPUs. Unless you are prepared to deal with multiple GPU devices.",

      "message": "If we ever allowed a Scenario to have more than one GPU, then all GPUs of both the Scenario and Rule would be compared against each other (with any match resulting in a match).  However, since a Scenario only gets one GPU, it really won\u0027t be a problem.  In my detailed unit tests (which will never be merged), I believe I tested both directions of multi-GPU situations.",

      "message": "Replying to your reply:\nYour suggestion \"all GPUs of both the Scenario and Rule would be compared against each other (with any match resulting in a match).\" looks ill defined to me.\nIf you have RuleA saying \"no ANGLE for GPU1\" and RuleB saying \"ANGLE for GPU2\", then since last matching rule overrides a previous one, what determines whether ANGLE will be used or not is the order between the rules, and this seems wrong to me.\nI can\u0027t think quickly of a good solution either.\n\nTo clarify my initial comment:\n1. Please change the \"for\" loop into examining only the first element in toCheck.mList in this CL or a followup, because your rules schema doesn\u0027t specify how to deal with multiple GPU devices, and examining only the first element keeps the old behavior and would be correct for single GPU devices.\n2. Add to your \"address more feedback\" bug an item to separate StringPart, IntegerPart, Version, Application, GPU, Device classes into Rule and Scenario versions. The classes in Scenario version should not have \"match()\" method, for example.\n3. And another item in the \"more feedback\" bug - specify how rules should be applied to devices with multiple GPUs.",

      "message": "Thinking about this some more...\n\nThis entire \"opt-in/out\" code was designed/written for Android.  When we designed it, we asked and somebody said that ANGLE had no need for it.  As a result, it was designed for a specific set of needs.  Things are named that way too.  Thus, we speak of a \"device\" (which is a phone, not a graphics card), which has a manufacturer and model (that come from certain Android properties that all OEMs must set).  There\u0027s always one-and-only GPU.\n\nIf there\u0027s ever a need for something like this, in a different environment, I\u0027ve thought that we\u0027d need to start from a set of requirements, which would drive the change(s).  Potentially, a different set of code might be needed (i.e. potentially a \"start over\" situation).  Without a definite need and set of requirements, I\u0027ve started resisting changes to handle \"what if\" situations that we may never need to handle.  You yourself hit me with that logic in your thorough review of this code (I had things that were either never used or no longer used--that you requested not be there:-).",
