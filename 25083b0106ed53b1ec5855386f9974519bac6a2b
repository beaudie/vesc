      "message": "Before you make this more complicated, I am wondering if we could actually switch SharedFence to use std::shared_ptr instead of our own refcounting. I had this question before, when I was working on SHaredFence. At that time I chose to keep using RefCounted mainly because it is already good enough to fit our needs (that we do not specifically needs thread safety). Now looks like you actually have a need to make the refcounting thread safe, then why not just switch to std::shared_ptr? The reason that destroy needs mDevice is easy to solve by storing mDevice in the object. Thoughts?",
