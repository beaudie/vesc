      "message": "I noticed the `PageFaultHandlerDefaultHandler` to be crashing for me locally as well on Linux and Android on release builds (using `is_debug \u003d false` in args.gn).\n\nApparently the calls wrapped in ASSERT got optimized out: \n```\nASSERT(sigaction(SIGSEGV, \u0026sigAction, nullptr) \u003d\u003d 0);\nASSERT(sigaction(SIGBUS, \u0026sigAction, nullptr) \u003d\u003d 0);\n```\n\nReplacing ASSERT with EXPECT_TRUE fixed the test on both Android and Linux on release builds.\n\nI will split this test into a separate commit.\n\nSince the ANGLE CI bots did not pick this up, how can I run it on the Chromium builders to make sure it\u0027s fixed?",
