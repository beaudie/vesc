      "message": "It is a bit frustrating, DEQP has a few places that will #error if _UNICODE is defined. As far as this change goes, it doesn\u0027t effect us at all since we have no real unicode support anyways.  The places where I changed L to TEXT or explicitly used the ASCII win32 functions are good changes to make so we can compile with or without unicode support enabled.",
