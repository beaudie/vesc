      "message": "Mohan, do you have this extension implemented? If so, please give the test in anglebug.com/3832 a try with this change: dEQP.GLES3/functional_primitive_restart_basic_lines_unsigned_byte_draw_elements_instanced\n\nNothing should really change (test passes both before and after), other than that there wouldn\u0027t be a VVL error about primitive restart.\n\nIf you driver doesn\u0027t implement this extension, it should take a whole 2 minutes to implement it :) The behavior is there in the hardware and the test works, you\u0027d just need to advertise it to make it official.",
