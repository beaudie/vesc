      "message": "In patch set 3 I tried to put log messages to indicate that the vulkan extension was supported, and to print when switching from multi-image swapchain to a single image swapchain. But, that never prints out. But some suites run the tests without any message. Only those that do not support the extension printed that and printed out \"Not Supported\" by the test. So it doesn\u0027t seem definitive that we have a pass case.",

      "message": "Hm, it\u0027s a bit tricky, because it means that internally the ImageHelper needs to know if this is a \"mutable\" image, transition once, then ignore all following image transitions. It\u0027s like a weird form of GENERAL. It\u0027ll interact with all of the image layout ImageHelper APIs. Having a lot of testing with validation layer checks would be recommended. ANGLE calls the image layout APIs throughout, we might need to rethink it to support this usage, not sure.",

I have no clue at this time.\n\nI am supposing that UNDEFINED-\u003eSharedPresent would likely do nothing? After that it just stays that way, which I guess anywhere else it might change and we needed to do something?\n\nWhile the tests are not failing, And I can see logs that say \"Not Supported\u0027 and other logs that just list the dEQP-EGL...render_buffer.* test, I haven\u0027t had a log that says - extension enabled (from by debug messages), transitioned to single image mode (from debug messages), and passed. So I\u0027m not sure if the tests are actually running, or if running and skipping without a message.\n\nThe lack of transition doesn\u0027t seem to cause issue so far, but maybe tests are not fully ran.",
