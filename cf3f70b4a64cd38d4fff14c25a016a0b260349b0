      "message": "It seems difficult to solve the problem by using the existing observer message as it is.\nSo I implemented to set only DirtyBit using message that are not used in Texture and Framebuffer.\nI don\u0027t know if it\u0027s okay with observer message design, but now I think the bug won\u0027t happen.\n\nCould you retry the test?",

      "message": "If you don\u0027t mind, could you please advise how can I update the RenderTargetCache without using the message?\n\nI understand this problem as follows:\n1. To fix the bug, DIRTY_BIT_xxxxx_ATTACHMENT_n must be set in the Framebuffer when TextureStorage is released.\n2. Texture needs to notify the Framebuffer to which it is attached with the observer\u0027s SubjectIndex(attachment index).\n\nIs there another way to set the dirty bit of the Framebuffer without calling onStateChanged in TextureD3D? (TextureD3D -\u003e Texture -\u003e Framebuffer)\n\nSorry to bother you.",
