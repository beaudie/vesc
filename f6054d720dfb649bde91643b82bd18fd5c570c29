      "message": "Having a different setting for something so fundamental seems like a bad idea to me, but again I\u0027m not an ANGLE reviewer. I\u0027d encourage you to not use \u003cfuture\u003e.\n\nHaving said that, clang-cl can now parse the \u003cfuture\u003e header as far as I can tell. If you want to go ahead with this patch as-is, you could include \u003ceh.h\u003e before including \u003cfuture\u003e, and then it\u0027ll compile fine with -D_HAS_EXCEPTIONS\u003d0 too. You\u0027ll still get a warning from cl about this being a bad idea.\n\n(Also see notes on https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d459797)",

      "message": "Given that clang-cl is getting more compatible, I think we can decide between turning it on for all Windows/WinRT with \u003cfuture\u003e or with a hand-rolled threads lib on top of Win32 threads. Nico do you know of any runtime problems could come about from using \u003cfuture\u003e?",
