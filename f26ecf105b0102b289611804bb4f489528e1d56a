      "message": "PTAL. This change by itself doesn\u0027t enable any tests, though there are already parts of RewriteStructSamplers that have become noop.\n\nTests pass on Linux and Android. Windows took forever to compile before I uploaded PS#5. If any failures show up from webgl tests for example, they would be corner cases to handle.\n\nThe change is good for review nevertheless.",
