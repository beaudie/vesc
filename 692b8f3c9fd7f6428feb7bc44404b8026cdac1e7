Otherwise the binary generated is always going to mismatch ANGLE commit hash and fail to load whenever there is a change in ANGLE. But that is not your CL try to solve.",

To tie the restricted hash check into this change, we can replace `angle::GetANGLECommitHash()` and `angle::GetANGLECommitHashSize()` with `angle::GetANGLEShaderProgramVersion()`, which is going to be introduced in an upcoming change similar to this one: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/4113445. I will let you know once the change is landed.",
