      "message": "Since you\u0027re working around here, would you mind (as a follow up), moving this out of prepareSwap entirely?\n\nIt was wrong to put it here, because this function is called without any front-end locks. Calling `doDeferredAcquireNextImage` in its entirety is also wrong. I was going to change this so that it only calls `vkAcquireNextImageKHR` once and return no matter what the result is, but I\u0027m not sure how much time I can spend working this week. If you move this out, it\u0027ll help me with that.",
