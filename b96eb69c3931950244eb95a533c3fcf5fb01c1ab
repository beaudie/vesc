      "message": "This isn\u0027t meant to catch perf regressions so much as prevent pathological cases in test execution. That being said I did this because I was seeing a large number of test cases flake on the first test across numerous OSes and configs. Ideally we could give the first test \"slow\" status and then pop down the timeout for subsequent tests. I felt this was safe enough to combine with this CL - sorry I will add some more comments explaining some of this reasoning.",
