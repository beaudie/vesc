      "message": "I bit the bullet and added the semaphore helper class. Autofreeing semaphores as in the previous patches just ended up being more troublesome than useful (in particular that, since the semaphores are reused in the pool, they should be waited on if ever signaled no matter if the corresponding submission is definitely finished, so the semaphore signaled as part of the last submission must stay alive until the next submission no matter what)",
