      "message": "@jamie \nMaybe the comment I added when opening the review git lost ... I\u0027m not very happy about this solution either, especially because we use a flag that is kind of not really needed for capture/replay, we just happen to enable it to ensure that the traces are not dependent on the back-end, and for replay we enable it to make the tests pass. The moment we\u0027d run the capture/replay tests without this flag enabled, this test would fail again.\nI think a better solution would either be to test whether this is a MEC, and only then keep the state (in this case we don\u0027t test whether capture works as expected for MEC), or we add a flag somewhere that says that shaders should not be detached here, and set this flag when capturing or replaying.    \n\n@cody\nConsidering that we don\u0027t use the context serializations (yet) we could just not record a state that is known to be different. Currently. the problem with tagging  is that we compare the strings of the context serializations, and handling them when comparing, is not simple - no more plain strcmp, and no simple diff in capture/replay script.",
