A better test maybe change EXPECT_PIXEL_COLOR_EQ to a copyTexSubImage to another texture or PBO read or something that will not end renderpass.",

The test is trying to make sure an appropriate loadOp is used (i.e. not DONT_CARE) after a validate, so the validation shouldn\u0027t be mid-RP.\n\nThe next test indeed tests mid-RP invalidate (which is also why it only validates alpha).",
