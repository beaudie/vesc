Or are we misleading developers using AGI to profile their applications which won\u0027t be using ANGLE in production?   Since it\u0027s the same underlying HW, presumably the format is handled the same for both GLES and VK, but I don\u0027t know what kinds of tricks are available to the native driver that we can\u0027t use.",
