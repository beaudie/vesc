      "message": "Hey Quyen! I hope you are doing well and happy new year. I was hoping to get some pointers for this change, if you are available.\n\nI\u0027ve made a change here where the transform feedback buffers are turned into an array of 4 (fixed size), rather than having one buffer declared per attribute. I\u0027m having trouble figuring out what (blindly) change in the metal code to support this. In Vulkan, a buffer array gets a unique binding; my first question is, is that the same with metal? I\u0027m looking at mtl_glslang_utils.mm (BindBuffers), and the logic under `case kGlslangDefaultUniformAndXfbDescSet:` needs to change in ways I can\u0027t really tell how.\n\nBasically I need to replicate these changes in vulkan/ here in metal/, and I\u0027m having a hard time understanding the architecture:\n\n- Have one binding for the xfb buffers array\n- Always bind 4 xfb buffers (use dummy buffers if fewer xfb buffers used)\n  * This touches multiple pieces of code",
