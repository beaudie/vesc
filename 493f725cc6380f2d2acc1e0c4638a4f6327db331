I suggest:\n\n\"If its value is EGL_TRUE, the window surface\u0027s size in pixels is specified by the EGL_WIDTH and EGL_HEIGHT attributes, and will not change throughout the lifetime of the surface. If its value is EGL_FALSE, then the window surface must be resized by the implementation subsequent to the native window being resized, and prior to copying its contents to the native window (e.g. in eglSwapBuffers, as described in section 3.9.1.1). The default value is EGL_FALSE.\"",
