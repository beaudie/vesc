      "message": "To try and reduce the license issues with ANGLE is AOSP, this CL removes all of the unused libraries from third_party/.   I\u0027ve uploaded a CL with what this looks like in AOSP:\nhttps://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/external/angle/+/1734516\n\nAuditing the remaining libraries with the scan_project tool is available here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1T4kyhdkOTHsL9MoB8gq1tFIZHxHYhPC3bbHuavrLr0U/edit#bookmark\u003did.g05t50ukhoow\n\nWhile this should make it easier to convince everyone that all of the used libraries have acceptable licenses, this obviously causes a bit of a divergence between ToT ANGLE and what\u0027s in AOSP, so let me know what you think.",
