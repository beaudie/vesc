Adding Shabi to CC as well.\n\nThanks for including the prototype at the test level so we can see an implementation.\n\nI\u0027m still a bit undecided on how this will live within ANGLE. We don\u0027t typically implement a feature like this in the frontend layer because it involves modifying GL state that is directly queryable by the user and often backends can make their own API specific optimizations.",
