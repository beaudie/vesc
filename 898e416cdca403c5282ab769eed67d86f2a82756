Adding Shabi to CC as well.\n\nThanks for including the prototype at the test level so we can see an implementation.\n\nI\u0027m still a bit undecided on how this will live within ANGLE. We don\u0027t typically implement a feature like this in the frontend layer because it involves modifying GL state that is directly queryable by the user and often backends can make their own API specific optimizations.",

      "message": "Thanks for the review! I don\u0027t have permissions to submit changes, so can I get you to do the submit?\n\nI also agree that this might be most optimal as API-specific code in each backend, but luckily there\u0027s still a lot of progress to be made with the bootstrapped version as-is, and that will shed some light on how we want the final implementation to work.",
