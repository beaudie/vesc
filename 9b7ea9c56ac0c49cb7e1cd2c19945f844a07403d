      "message": "Thanks!\nIn case of the tested app, the performance improvement is coming from updating the comparison threshold from `mSize / 4` to `mSize / 8`. Using the new threshold, I tried changing the decay coefficient to 65%, 50%, and even 25%, but there is no change in FPS.\nIn the new patch, I have rounded the coefficient to 60%.\n* Similar to 63%, it takes 5 allocations to cross 12.5% (the 1000 to 1 exponential decay).",
