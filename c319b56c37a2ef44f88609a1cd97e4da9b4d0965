      "message": "Ah, good catch.  Most of the other OES_texture_3D functions call into a base validation function which checks for texture3DOES extension.  glFramebufferTexture3D doesn\u0027t exist beyond the extension (it is replaced by glFramebufferTextureLayer in 3.+), so we should check for it here.  I see that ValidateFramebufferTextureLayer is implemented, so we could theoretically route to that, but there are enough differences between the functions (3D is more limited), that I would lean toward keeping the OES version validated by itself.  If anyone thinks otherwise (minimize code duplication at the cost of complexity) let me know.",
