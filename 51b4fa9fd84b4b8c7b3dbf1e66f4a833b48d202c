I\u0027m wondering about the performance counter class that Jamie created, and something that can simulate the effects of apps whose rendering is faster/slower-than vsync.  I remember there being some multi-thread test(s) that had a way of synchronizing the normally-unsynchronized world of threads.  Doesn\u0027t have to be done for this CL, but I wanted to plant that seed in case you can do it.",
