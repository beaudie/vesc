      "message": "I\u0027m trying a different work-around.  This work-around doesn\u0027t rotate the damage rectangles.\n\nI had the thought that perhaps SF/HWC is also rotating the damage rectangles (a double-rotation by both ANGLE and SF/HWC would account for what we see).  That might help \"Extreme Car Driving Simulator\" if it\u0027s not doing a full-window damage rectangle (like the other work-around).  If so, this would be the better work-around (after cleaned up and commented).",
