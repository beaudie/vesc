      "message": "I\u0027m trying a different work-around.  This work-around doesn\u0027t rotate the damage rectangles.\n\nI had the thought that perhaps SF/HWC is also rotating the damage rectangles (a double-rotation by both ANGLE and SF/HWC would account for what we see).  That might help \"Extreme Car Driving Simulator\" if it\u0027s not doing a full-window damage rectangle (like the other work-around).  If so, this would be the better work-around (after cleaned up and commented).",

      "message": "In it\u0027s current form, yes.\n\nThere\u0027s an Android platform/driver bug (I think in the Qualcomm HWC driver) that I\u0027m trying to deal with (see the bugs in this CL--there are times part of the screen updates and the other part doesn\u0027t).  Things point to a bug in Qualcomm\u0027s HWC driver with the VK_KHR_incremental_present extension.\n\nMy other CL (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/2739999) fixes the problem with 2 games, but not others.  I want to see if this \"test CL\" fixes additional games.\n\nIf this fixes all of those games, I will do a proper fix.",
