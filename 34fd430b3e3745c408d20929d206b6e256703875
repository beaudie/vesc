      "message": "Are all these special paths just to have this counter? Can we simplify things by having garbage collection be done as usual, and have the one adding image garbage do something like `onImageGarbageCollected(size)`? That\u0027ll probably simplify this change a lot.\n\nYou\u0027d probably need to add feedback from `collectGarbage` about which path was taken.",

      "message": "You could do that, but you will need to dig into vk::GarbageList and check each element if it is image garbage or not (when a pending garbage has been submitted). I think it is a bit too much for every garbage processing.\n\nOne way to de-dduplicate the code is template all these different versions of collect***Garbage into one templated function.",

It\u0027s going to propagate to a few other functions, but it should work out. Only `onDestroy` probably has to `(void)` it.\n\n---\n\nThat said, perhaps we should recosider where this check is done. How about putting it at render pass end? That would avoid having to break the RP. If we do hit OOM before the render pass ends, your other change would cause a flush anyway, right?",
