Makes sense?\n\nThings like this is part of the reason I don\u0027t like the wrappers in mNodeBuilder.",

The comment and the bug say `unpack`, but actually you are talking about `pack`. I\u0027m not quite so sure about `pack`. The GLSL spec doesn\u0027t require the _input_ to be highp, so it\u0027s probably actually valid to give it `mediump`.\n\n\u003e Is that expected to map to ShShaderOutput?\n\nNo. It\u0027s just the shader version. Like `100`, `300`, `310` or `320` (i.e. the same thing that comes after `#version`). For `packUnorm4x8` for example you\u0027d need to use `310`. See `DriverUniform::getFlipXY` actually for how to properly do it that works across ES and desktop GLSL frontends.",
