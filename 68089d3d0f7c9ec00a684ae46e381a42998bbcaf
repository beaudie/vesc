      "message": "Anything is possible, though it would be easy to break tests. I don\u0027t believe we would need to have both versions running for too long, maybe two or three months? Once this path proves capable, we can remove glslang-based testing (and move to post commit?) until it\u0027s entirely removed.\n\nI thought dEQP tests are fast enough? How about something like ES3.1 on windows (because newer driver), ES3 and ES2 on Linux? Android is obviously more critical, can we afford running everything on that? Otherwise ES3.1 on Android is probably more important.",

Would Android be able to handle ES3.1 only?\n\n\u003e I was hoping for something like 1 week.\n\nI would love to, but I suspect we would want to keep glslang around for a few months (even if disabled by default) in case a new app starts failing shader compilation and we need to compare the output of ANGLE with glslang\u0027s.\n\nAlso, taking into account vacations, I\u0027d say one month is the minimum!",
