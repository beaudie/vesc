      "message": "I think this was a bug in 26581113047a8a656e6af0a164bdf976e6543270. The src image was being checked for BLIT_DST and the dst image was being checked for BLIT_SRC.\n\nIt\u0027s possible (though I haven\u0027t verified) that this was resulting in some tests choosing a slow path where they could have chosen the fast path (in addition to the fact that `vk::GetFormatProperties` was not returning the complete features)",

      "message": "An accidental bug fix here: IsMaskFlagSet(m, v) translates to `(m \u0026 v) \u003d\u003d v`. This usage had the parameters reversed, and when `linearTilingFeatures` was 0^, this would just get accepted.\n\n^ especially since linearTilingFeatures was never queried from the device, given the original bug this CL was set out to resolve.",
