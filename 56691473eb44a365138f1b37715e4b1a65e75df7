If the next command for example closes the CB, then the buffer barriers above for example will still be recorded on the old CB.\n\n---\n\nAlso, since the RP is closed in line 4481, why is anything here flushing the CB?!",

Please add a comment to 4583 that says the staging image could have been used in a render pass and that onImageTransferRead may have caused the command buffers to be flushed.",
