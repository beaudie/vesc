      "message": "Thanks.\n\n\u003e curious where we would handle doubles\n\nWe don\u0027t. `double` is in desktop GLSL only. And besides, we already handle flat perfectly fine per the GL spec (and Vulkan spec is largely the same). It\u0027s the FS _builtins_ where `int` implies `flat` even though it\u0027s not specified in the declaration of the builtin in the spec. I don\u0027t believe desktop GL would have builtin doubles that need to be implicitly made flat!",
