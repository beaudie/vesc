I think LIBANGLE_IMPLEMENTATION is (rightly?) not defined when compiling Chrome, and so  __attribute__((visibility (\"default\"))) is not set, which means the functions pointers still reference a hidden type, which then doesn\u0027t get coalesced with the one from ANGLE.\n\nI think we either have to make ANGLE_PLATFORM_EXPORT always define to __attribute__((visibility (\"default\"))) (regardless of LIBANGLE_IMPLEMENTATION), or need another macro",
