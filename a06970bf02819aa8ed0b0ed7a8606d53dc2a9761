      "message": "DeleteSystemFile might be a confusing name since it makes it sound like it is for deleting system files, rather than a system function for deleting files. Maybe SystemDeleteFile? Although that is clunky in a different way.\n\nYou could call it DeleteFileA, since that is what it ultimately calls on Windows, but I\u0027m not thrilled with that name.",
