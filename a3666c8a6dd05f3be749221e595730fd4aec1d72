      "message": "Well the format itself (32-bit 8-bit-per-channel RGBA) is most definitely renderable in GLES2. Is this an issue of sized format (RGBA8) vs unsized format (RGBA + GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE)?\n\nThe way we typically handle this is to add an ANGLE extension that exposes the format in the version we want. In this case, you can add something similar to `ANGLE_rgbx_internal_format.txt` but for rgba8 and have it apply to GLES2. Then a GLES2 context in ANGLE that supports the RGBA8 sized format (one that can be GLES3+) can expose the extension which automatically means applications (including Chrome) can use this format for rendering from GLES2 contexts.",
