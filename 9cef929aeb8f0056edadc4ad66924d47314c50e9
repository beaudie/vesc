      "message": "This is probably not the right place for this. Actually that means we have another bug too. Take this scenario:\n\n1. Previous swap\n2. Draw to FBO\n3. ANI\n4. Draw to swapchain\n5. swap\n\nIIUC, age should be the same at steps 2 and 4, but they wouldn\u0027t be with this change. You can add a regression test based on this. Currently, age at step 4 would show 0, don\u0027t you think?\n\nI think we need to make two changes:\n\n- Set this right before queue present (i.e. swap). In other words, the age remains \"old\" until swap time.\n- getBufferAge should do this first:\n\n        if (mNeedToAcquireNextSwapchainImage)\n        {\n            // Acquire the next image (previously deferred).\n            ANGLE_TRY(doDeferredAcquireNextImage(context, false));\n        }\n\n   otherwise it would use the wrong index before ANI (step 2 in above scenario).",

      "message": "What I noticed, I need to set the mFrameNumber of the current Image just before AcquireNextImage, because otherwise it gets updated to current mFrameCount and the age (ols mFrameNumber) is lost - resulting in a getBufferAge of 1. At AcquireNextImage, the index is moved forward to the next image. That\u0027s why this spot works.\n\nputting mFrameNumber assignment and mFrameCount in swapImpl, anywhere, results in an age of 1. \n\nAt step 3 above, we are switching Images, So the age is not the same.\n\nIt might be better to move \n    mSwapchainImages[mCurrentSwapchainImageIndex].mFrameNumber \u003d mFrameCount++;\nto middle of WindowSurfaceVk::doDefferedAcquireNextImage(); before call to acquireNextSwapchainImage - this seems to skip some initialization paths that probably don\u0027t need it.",

      "message": "I think we could reach a better understanding if you implemented my suggested test.\n\nOne problem is, in that scenario at step 2 we are returning the wrong age altogether. That\u0027s because mCurrentSwapchainImageIndex is not changed (as ANI is deferred). That\u0027s the reason you see the wrong age when updating mFrameCount in swapImpl; it\u0027s because before ANI we have the wrong index.\n\nSo my two suggestions go hand-in-hand. getBufferAge should make sure ANI is done (so the index is correct), then updating mFrameCount can move to swapImpl (though it would work if it stayed here, I believe it\u0027s more meaningful that way).",

      "message": "\"I think we could reach a better understanding if you implemented my suggested test.\n\"\n\nThis test is different than what you requested? It uses buffer age to check that the buffer has the expected contents. See:\n\n// Verify contents of buffer are as expected\nTEST_P(EGLBufferAgeTest, VerifyContents)\n\n\nDebug logs: Loop 3 and 4 still have age age 0, so the color/content is not glReadPixels and defaults to black.  Not sure why but I have hacked and verified that the contents are indeed blue and cyan as expected. It is also odd that eglSwapBuffers comes after ANI. Otherwise the content is as expected.\n\n[ RUN      ] EGLBufferAgeTest.VerifyContents/ES3_Vulkan_NoFixture\n\nLoop: 0 age: 0 Color: Black\nCall eglSwapBuffers()\n\nLoop: 1 age: 0 Color: Black\nPre call to  acquireNextSwapchainImage(): ImageIndex: 0 FrameCount: 0\nPost call to acquireNextSwapchainImage(): ImageIndex: 1 FrameCount: 1\nCall eglSwapBuffers()\n\nLoop: 2 age: 0 Color: Black\nPre call to  acquireNextSwapchainImage(): ImageIndex: 1 FrameCount: 1\nPost call to acquireNextSwapchainImage(): ImageIndex: 2 FrameCount: 2\nCall eglSwapBuffers()\n\nLoop: 3 age: 0 Color: Black\nPre call to  acquireNextSwapchainImage(): ImageIndex: 2 FrameCount: 2\nPost call to acquireNextSwapchainImage(): ImageIndex: 0 FrameCount: 3\nCall eglSwapBuffers()\n\nLoop: 4 age: 0 Color: Black\nPre call to  acquireNextSwapchainImage(): ImageIndex: 0 FrameCount: 3\nPost call to acquireNextSwapchainImage(): ImageIndex: 1 FrameCount: 4\nCall eglSwapBuffers()\nPre call to  acquireNextSwapchainImage(): ImageIndex: 1 FrameCount: 4\nPost call to acquireNextSwapchainImage(): ImageIndex: 2 FrameCount: 5\n\nLoop: 5 age: 3 Color: (64, 64, 64, 255)\nCall eglSwapBuffers()\nPre call to  acquireNextSwapchainImage(): ImageIndex: 2 FrameCount: 5\nPost call to acquireNextSwapchainImage(): ImageIndex: 0 FrameCount: 6\n\nLoop: 6 age: 3 Color: Green\nCall eglSwapBuffers()\nPre call to  acquireNextSwapchainImage(): ImageIndex: 0 FrameCount: 6\nPost call to acquireNextSwapchainImage(): ImageIndex: 1 FrameCount: 7\n\nLoop: 7 age: 3 Color: Red\nCall eglSwapBuffers()\nPre call to  acquireNextSwapchainImage(): ImageIndex: 1 FrameCount: 7\nPost call to acquireNextSwapchainImage(): ImageIndex: 2 FrameCount: 8\n\n\n\nI am looking into your other comments",
