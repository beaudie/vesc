      "message": "nit: the extension is not actually implemented yet! My suggestion is to keep this disabled until implementation is actually done. You can still have your tests force-enable this extension by doing this:\n\n- In `include/platform/frontend_features.json`, add a front-end feature like `emulatePixelLocalStorage`\n- In `Display.cpp`, use `ANGLE_FEATURE_CONDITION` to default initialize it to false. When the implementation is completed, this can be flipped to true. Backends that specialize the implementation would make sure it stays false.\n- In `Context::generateSupportedExtensions`, decide support for `shaderPixelLocalStorageANGLE` based on `emulatePixelLocalStorage`\n- In the test, where you instantiate the platforms, instead of `ANGLE_INSTANTIATE_TEST_ES31`, use:\n\n```\nANGLE_INSTANTIATE_TEST(...,\n                       ES31_VULKAN().enable(Feature::EmulatePixelLocalStorage),\n                       ...);\n```\n\nThis way, the extension isn\u0027t exposed to users while still WIP, while it is to the tests!",
