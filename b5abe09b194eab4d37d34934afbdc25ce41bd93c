      "message": "Some additional updates might be needed here per `EGL_KHR_mutable_render_buffer` spec:\n```\n    If surface is a single-buffered window, pixmap, or pbuffer surface for which\n    there is a pending change to the EGL_RENDER_BUFFER attribute, eglSwapBuffers\n    performs an implicit flush operation on the context and effects the\n    attribute change. If surface is a single-buffered window, pixmap, or pbuffer\n    surface for which there is no pending change to the EGL_RENDER_BUFFER\n    attribute, eglSwapBuffers has no effect.\n```\nI can see now `glFlush` is doing the right thing. Can we update `eglSwapBuffers` to follow the spec as well? I see some apps doing redundant `eglSwapBuffers` but ANGLE is still doing the `WindowSurfaceVk::present` there (hurts performance). That is better to be avoided I think.",
