      "message": "This code is kind of hard to understand. Could you please give better names to the variables (like what is sameSrcRemainingCount?) and add a comment as to what exactly is going on?\n\nAlso, could you please check to see what happens if `dstStride` is say 128, and `srcStride` is say 32 and bytesToAllocate is 128k+32 (or if that\u0027s even possible)? Are `k` vertices copied and the last 32 bytes are set to 0, or k+1 vertices are copied?\n\nI\u0027m asking because we had issues before where an incomplete last stride (yet complete enough to include vertex data in that last incomplete stride) would read 0 in Vulkan on AMD but not in GL, and we had to extend the buffer size to make the stride complete. Just want to be sure we don\u0027t reintroduce that issue.",
