      "message": "Sorry for the late reply (was trying to reply after I finish the doc).  Yes, the problem is that one driver implements texsubimage call by make a shadow copy of the full texture. Even though we reduced texsubimage to 1x1, gles driver is making the copy of original sized texture and CPU time will be dominated by that. That itself of course is something interesting enough that worth performance comparison, but it does dwarf all other state management calls that make comparison harder. By skip it (and the other follow on CLs that also get rid of data copies), now I am able to completely get rid of utility thread activity and we can do apple to apple comparison on render thread between native and gles. The data copy performance can be easily evaluated by writing a standalone test. For this specific purpose, we better just leave data copy out of picture, that is the reason for this and next CL.",

      "message": "OK - I guess my concern still remains that this cuts out the CPU time that would be present by including the call. We don\u0027t have the control necessary to split the cpu overhead from the driver with this approach. SGTM if it\u0027s useful in your measurements - I\u0027d leave a note or even a static flag that could enable these cutouts for each of the places where you\u0027re removing calls, not just modifying the dimensions.",
