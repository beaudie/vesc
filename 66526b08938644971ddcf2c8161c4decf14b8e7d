      "message": "It is needed here. The dirty bit system for VAOs (and framebuffers) is a bit odd.\nHere\u0027s what happens if it\u0027s not there:\n1) There is an active program with multiple views (check last scenario in the DivisorOrderOfOperation test).\n2) We bind the vao at a moment it has not dirtied bits.\n3) setVertexArrayBinding gets called and only the DIRTY_BIT_VERTEX_ARRAY_BINDING dirty bit gets set. The DIRTY_OBJECT_VERTEX_ARRAY is not set.\n4) DIRTY_BIT_VERTEX_ARRAY_BINDING gets gone through in StateManagerGL, applyNumViewsToDivisor gets called and the local dirty bits are set, but updateBindingDivisor doesn\u0027t get called.\n5) syncState never gets called because DIRTY_OBJECT_VERTEX_ARRAY was never set dirty.\n\nLet\u0027s keep it as it is for now, it can probably be removed if we can do some kind of refactoring of the dirty bit system.",
