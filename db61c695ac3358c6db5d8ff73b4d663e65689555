      "message": "Right, the gl_MaxDrawBuffers constant is part of the ESSL 1 core spec.\n\nThe solution is not as simple as clamping the limits here though.  If you modify your test to only use one framebuffer, trying to bind to a non-zero attachment when the framebuffer was created before the extension was enabled, it will crash.\n\nI think it is less bug-prone if the caps were kept as is and we artificially limit gl_MaxDrawBuffers in Compiler::Compiler when we\u0027re in ES2 and don\u0027t have EXT_draw_buffers available.  I\u0027d rather not update the internal state of all framebuffers at runtime.\n\nThis brings up another issue, we need to make sure the compiler is re-created after an extension is enabled so that it has updated extensions.  This should be as simple as deleting the old mCompiler and creating a new one in Context::requestExtension.",
