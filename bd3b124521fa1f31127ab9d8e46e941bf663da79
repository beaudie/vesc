      "message": "FYI ... The idea of this function is to turn back on the STORE storeOp when an attachment is being used again (since I didn\u0027t end the render pass in invalidateImpl().  I\u0027m assuming that if a color attachment has been invalidated, it should be \"restored\" (un-invalidated).  For depth/stencil, I only want to restore them if they are enabled (PUBG invalidates the depth/stencil buffers and then disables the depth/stencil functionality, and then keeps drawing to the color attachment).",
