Change of format is not the only reason an update may be incompatible, the extents of the mip could also be incompatible and this is not catching it.\n\nThis may be happening due to reformatting? In that case, maybe the reformatting code is missing an adjustment to TextureVk::mRedefinedLevels.\n\nCould you please revert this back to ASSERT and debug the issue? I\u0027ll help you the best I can with this.",
