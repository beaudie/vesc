      "message": "I do think that SWIFTSHADER as a driver makes more sense, but that requires some auditing, as for example any VULKAN suppression would suddenly apply to swiftshader too.\n\nHowever, in this particular case I\u0027d say just SKIP these to match the NVIDIA failure (though I\u0027m surprised that\u0027s reported as a conflict). I imagine clang would be fixed in response, so these should be removed soon anyway.",
