I can\u0027t say what will happen on GLES side just looking at the source code). I need to build Chromium and run tests locally. I have never done this and afraid that I do not have time to invest in such thing on my own without external support.\n\nUnfortunately, I\u0027m currently occupied with other tasks and can\u0027t actively participate in contributing into this repository for some time.\n\n\u003e I hate how wishy-washy the safety of this turned out. Hopefully the context split works out and we can fix that. This works in the meantime and at least now we know what part of the context we can really split.\n\nI hope everything will work out at the end.",
