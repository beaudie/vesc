      "message": "Unfortunately I do not recall the details. \n\nWhen I updated to a more recent ANGLE version in Qt I ran into crashes when the window size was reduced. If it was a general thing I guess someone would have noticed. So I guess it might have been specific to Qt\u0027s usage of ANGLE, so maybe not relevant for upstream. \n\nBut that\u0027s just a guess right now",
