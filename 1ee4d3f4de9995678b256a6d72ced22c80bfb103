      "message": "Is framebuffer change the only way this can happen? My suggested message was trying to be helpful when this happens for other reasons. But now that I think about it, maybe it\u0027s best to limit this to framebuffer changes.\n\nWhat do you think of setting `mAllowRenderPassToReactivate` to false in `onRenderPassFinished()`, and only set it to true when handling `DIRTY_BIT_DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING`? Then you can also remove the bit you added in `handleDirtyAnySamplePassedQueryEnd`.\n\nThat way we could be selective about the conditions we let the RP revive.",
