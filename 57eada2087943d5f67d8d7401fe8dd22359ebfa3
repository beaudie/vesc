Instead, we should just use SH_EMULATE_BUILT_IN_FUNCTIONS to turn on/off builtin function rewrite, and actually to turn which function rewrite on on a certain platform should just be ANGLE logic (i.e., SH_EMULATE_BUILT_IN_FUNCTIONS just give Chrome a flag to turn it off, so we could demonstrate / test driver bugs and their fixes using Chrome)",
