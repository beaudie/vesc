      "message": "Sorry for not being clear.  What I mean is, we will have too many functions to work around, and this flag will soon be out of bits.  Instead, we should just use SH_EMULATE_BUILT_IN_FUNCTIONS to turn on/off builtin function rewrite, and actually to turn which function rewrite on on a certain platform should just be ANGLE logic (i.e., SH_EMULATE_BUILT_IN_FUNCTIONS just give Chrome a flag to turn it off, so we could demonstrate / test driver bugs and their fixes using Chrome)",

      "message": "We\u0027ve discussed the bit problem previously locally in Montreal - we are OK with changing to a 64-bit enum for now, and can revisit this problem when we run close to the end of 64-bits. We can use a std::bitset or similar design when necessary. I\u0027d be in favour of keeping the \u0027many flags\u0027 design, as it avoids annoying problems that crop up with \"Optimization level\" type designs.",
