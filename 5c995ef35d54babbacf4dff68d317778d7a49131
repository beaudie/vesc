      "message": "Thanks! So this is a bit funny: the error is `Could not load EGL entry point eglQueryDmaBufFormatsEXT`, meaning the test is run on top of a buggy driver that announces `EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import_modifiers` without implementing `eglQueryDmaBufFormatsEXT`.\n\nAFAIK there\u0027s only one such driver that comes into question here, which is Angle-EGL before Ifbb0a182171646df8161f6f42eafe2a476fea6b2\n\nSo IIUC the scenario here is new Angle-EGL running on top of older Angle-EGL - is that realistic?\n\nIf so, I see two ways to solve that:\n1. wait until the test/CI is updated to newer Angle, including the fix.\n2. fail softly if `eglQueryDmaBufFormatsEXT` or `eglQueryDmaBufModifiersEXT` are not implemented by the driver and remove `EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import_modifiers` from the extension list.\n \nI\u0027ll look into proposing a reland with 2., assuming 1. will take quite a while.",
