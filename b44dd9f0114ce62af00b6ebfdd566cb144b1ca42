Part of me wants to say they should be pure virtual at the TextureD3D level, and that any child for which they don\u0027t make sense should provide UNIMPLEMENTED() methods themselves explicitly, so no one\u0027s exposing them inadvertently. But another part of me would be annoyed at the code duplication. Other reviewers-- opinions?",
