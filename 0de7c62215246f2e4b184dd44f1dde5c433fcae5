      "message": "First off, cool that you got this working.\n\nThe bad news: there\u0027s some code patterns here that don\u0027t fit with the Vulkan back-end and the current design sacrifices maintainability. e.g.: using a WrappedObject on top of a custom pointer class, inheriting from RefCounted, and possibly how you keep the reference counts. Charlie - can you add a perf counter test that exercises the performance improvement you\u0027re shooting for? From that I can better guide you.",
