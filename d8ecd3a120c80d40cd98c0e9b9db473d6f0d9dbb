      "message": "While I couldn\u0027t reproduce the CFI crash locally, I see what the issue is based on the stack trace. The problem is that `WaitableEvent` holds a shared_ptr reference to the pool, and if that\u0027s the one that ends up destroying the pool, the thread ends up join()ing itself.\n\nI\u0027ll follow the revert up with a fixed reland",
