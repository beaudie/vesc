      "message": "In that case `lastPresentResult` will be always `VK_NOT_READY` when `asyncCommandQueue` is disabled. I want to have valid `lastPresentResult` regardless of `asyncCommandQueue` status.\n\nTo have valid `lastPresentResult` when `asyncCommandQueue` is disabled need to update `lastPresentResult` in the `RendererVk`, and I think that this is a less clean solution.\n\nIn my initial implementation both `CommandQueue::queuePresent` and `CommandProcessor::enqueuePresent` were returning `VkResult` and also updated `lastPresentResult`. First result is for the `RendererVk` method itself (which may be `CommandProcessor::enqueuePresent` - not a present), and the `lastPresentResult` is the actual present result. Now, `CommandProcessor::enqueuePresent()` initializes  `lastPresentResult` to `VK_SUCCESS` that is technically incorrect.\n\nIMO it is better to have 2 VkResult. Return result for the synchronous operation, and `SwapchainStatus` for asynchronous. However, when `asyncCommandQueue` is disabled, `SwapchainStatus` is still updated synchronously for consistency. I think this way we even can remove check for `asyncCommandQueue` in the `WindowSurfaceVk` and check `SwapchainStatus` unconditionally.",
