This should work because `ContextVk::invalidateProgramExecutableHelper` calls `invalidateDefaultAttributes`, but would be nice to make sure this scenario is tested:\n\n- Set up 2 default attribs\n- Use program 1 that only uses 1 attrib\n- Change to program 2 that uses 2 attribs\n\nThis was first done in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/1188951, but I don\u0027t see any test suppressions lifted :/\n\nHopefully something would fail if you remove that line.",
