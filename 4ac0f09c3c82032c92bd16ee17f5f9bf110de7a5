I don\u0027t think we should keep pointers to the renderer both in the abstract base and in the concrete child class-- either we should use MakeRenderer11 on the parent\u0027s protected mRenderer on the occasions we need to access Renderer11 functions from the child (in which case I think the getRenderer() function in the parent can be entirely removed), or go back to using a virtual function.",
