I\u0027m trying to make sure coverage is varied so I don\u0027t accidentally miss things due to tests passing on one platform but not the others.\n\nLike anti-aliased points are not implemented, but passing tests! Not even sure what\u0027s the deal with rescale-normal: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/3896213\n\nAgain, I want to make sure the tests run everywhere so I don\u0027t accidentally think the job\u0027s done.",
