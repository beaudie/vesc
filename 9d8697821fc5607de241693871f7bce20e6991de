      "message": "Back for review again. I think there is a QC driver bug here that somehow if I add two new tests, even though I skip them, some other tests (not related to tests I added here) will crash. But if I add these two tests in existing tests, it works fine. Very odd, but unfortunately I do not know whats going on. The crash was in QC driver compiler code. Now I am adding these two tests into one of the existing test to avoid this issue.",

      "message": "This workaround feels hacky, but since it only seems to affect Pixel 2 for now, it should be fine.   \n\nThere isn\u0027t any error checking being done in runTest() after any of the GL calls.   Are any of them generating errors in th CQ output that would signal something is going wrong?\n\nAlso, since this is doing a lot of buffer copy stuff, it would probably be a good idea to run these with ASAN on desktop to see if there are any out of bounds accesses occurring.   It\u0027s possible memory is being corrupted, and only causing issues when things move around and change execution order.",
