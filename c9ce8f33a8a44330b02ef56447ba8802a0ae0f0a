      "message": "Could you please wrap the precise members into a separate struct and put `precise` on the struct definition itself? The spec says:\n\n\u003e When applied to a block, a structure type, or a variable of structure type, precise applies to each contained member, recursively.\n\nSo `precise struct S { ... }` should work, and the test can remain as is.\n\nIf the implementation of `precise` on struct definitions is broken, I\u0027d rather have the tests ready with a bug filed that says implementation is broken, rather than the tests removed.",
