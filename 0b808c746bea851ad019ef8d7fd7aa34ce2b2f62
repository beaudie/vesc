      "message": "Here\u0027s a fairly unknown trick for verifying changes in deps: You can send a chromium-side try job that uses the pending, not-yet committed change by following these steps:\n\n1. Make a CL that changes a dep (like this one)\n2. On the CL\u0027s main review page (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/3651154 in this case), click DOWNLOAD. This gives you a string like \"refs/changes/54/3651154/2\"\n3. Copy that (difficult because the gerrit UI tries to be helpful in an annoying way) and paste it in DEPS in a chromium-side CL like so: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2066106/3/DEPS (this an old CL of mine, so it\u0027s a slightly different refs/ string)\n4. Send Chromium Cl to CQ. It\u0027s going to pull the pending deps cl for the try job.\n\n(I realize this CL here has landed and you don\u0027t need it for this, but it\u0027s a useful technique for the future, so I figured I\u0027d mention it.)",
