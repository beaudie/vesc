      "message": "On top lovel comment I think you missed in my previous review:\n\n\u003e On other thing is that the setObjectDirty abstraction seems like it will grow too coarse for the use case of setting the sampler / textures table dirty.\n\nAfter looking at this patch for a long time, multiple times I still can\u0027t seem to wrap my head around what\u0027s happening exactly. While the logic might be correct I\u0027m worried about future maintenance. Is there a design doc for this? We should have a consistent and extremely well documented mechanism for dirty bits otherwise this code will fall part quickly.",
