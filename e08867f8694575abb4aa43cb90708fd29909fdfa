      "message": "Not sure what would be the best design here - should this be pure virtual for example? Right now this function is used only for the D3D pbuffers, but I don\u0027t know if other cases might arise where it could be useful.\n\nOne option could also be to add a new base class specifically for D3D surfaces that would have this as a pure virtual function.",

This page https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff471325(v\u003dvs.85).aspx has some similar documentation as well, and it suggests that D3D 11.1 / DXGI 1.2 software support may be required for rendering and mip generation for these formats. However, that would apply to the non-SRGB format as well, so if my changes are wrong then there are a lot of other issues in here to fix as well.",
