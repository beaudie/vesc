      "message": "Overall the change itself looks ok to me. My main concern doing in spir-v level is hard to debug. Its like doing it in C versus assembly. If possible, you want to do it in C and let compiler handle for you, avoid coding in assembly. So IMO, using specialization constant is a better choice that has less work (although yu already did spir-v work), better main tenability. The \"unnecessary modifications to early stage\" part is not a real issue, since they will get removed by compiler. The only real issue is the shader size, which is also not a big issue.",

      "message": "I agree with Charlie.   I\u0027d much prefer using specialization constants that are easier to debug/maintain.   Especially with all of the corner cases related to pre-rotation that have been exposed, debugging/maintaining/improving this SPIR-V will essentially be impossible, or at least take much longer than it would with a higher level language.",
