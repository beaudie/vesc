      "message": "Hey Roman, what are the advantages of the approaches you list there? I like to run it this way because I can easily run the script from any directory. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much of a risk in causing harm as fragile as the script looks. I have coded a similar approach in other ANGLE scripts as well, see perf_test_runner.py in scripts/. Works well for me!",

      "message": "If I have `out/Android` and `out/Android2`, this will run one or the other based on whichever binary has the newest mtime, right? This allows for obscure mistakes like accidentally building the wrong binary then assuming it\u0027s running only to find later that it was running the wrong thing.\n\nApproaches that I listed avoid this by being explicit about what you want to run and result in an error instead of surprising behavior if the intended binary is missing.",

If we run into a costly issue like you described, I\u0027d be happy to believe that situation might occur. As it stands I haven\u0027t had that problem locally.
