      "message": "Skipping `context-\u003eisContextLost()` check will have different behavior.\n\nIn cases if Context is lost in other thread it will update TLS of that thread. This thread will have not `nullptr` TLS with lost Context.\n\nI do not know how we can fix Context Lost race.\nI guess implementing `GetValidGlobalContext()` is not possible if Context may be lost any time right after the call. So we need to use `GetGlobalContext()` everywhere and check for `isContextLost()` after acquiring the Context lock.\n\nWe also have race in this method for non-Shared Contexts.\n```\nvoid Display::notifyDeviceLost()\n{\n    if (mDeviceLost)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    for (ContextSet::iterator context \u003d mState.contextSet.begin();\n         context !\u003d mState.contextSet.end(); context++)\n    {\n        (*context)-\u003emarkContextLost(gl::GraphicsResetStatus::UnknownContextReset);\n    }\n\n    mDeviceLost \u003d true;\n}\n```",

      "message": "Thanks, I opened anglebug.com/8139 to track those races\n\nI don\u0027t believe this CL is adding a new race though; the race between \"get TLS\" and \"take share group lock\" exists both before and after this change. The `isContextLost` check here was still done before the share group lock is taken.\n\nHow about we take this change (so `isContextLost()` is removed from this path for the sake of your CL), and we can deal with the races (for all platforms) at some point later.",
