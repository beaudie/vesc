      "message": "Hey Roman, I don\u0027t have the ability to really confirm until I get back. My recollection is vague but the issue you commented on seemed to indicate it was a problem particular to using the run_perf_tests.py script on Android. So check the behaviour of the android test bot with the perftests (and you can also try in a local environment).",

      "message": "Right, so it could be that something was going wrong with `run_perf_tests.py` but now that script is no longer using the Android test runner - although I\u0027m not sure what could have been going wrong there previously either. I did poke at local runs with Android test runner but I just can\u0027t find clues about why --gtest_filter would need to be removed as the combinations I can think of seem to work normally.\n\nHow about going ahead with this an I\u0027ll take all the blame in case this breaks anything? :)  (we know this can only break Android though)",
