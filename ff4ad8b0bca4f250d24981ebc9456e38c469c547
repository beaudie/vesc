      "message": "wanted to keep `removeActiveThread` as a simple helper that does just 1 thing.\n\nI was thinking about this a bit more and it is not at all necessary to call `removeActiveThread` here. We can have good logical separation by allowing thread destruction call to perform any necessary cleanup and let `Display::terminate` not call into any additional cleanup routine. There is no value added by preempting the existing call flow with the clean up call flow when we can just wait for the thread to be destroyed and handle the clean up there. Let me know your thoughts",

It might do another eglInitialize or just hang around for whatever reason. For example, a thread could do eglInitialize -\u003e test -\u003e eglTerminate in a loop, and then we would postpone all cleanups until the very end.\n\nGiven that the thread explicitly called eglTerminate, shouldn\u0027t we go ahead with the cleanup simply by calling `removeActiveThreadAndPerformCleanup` here?

We don\u0027t need to invoke `terminate(NoActiveThreads)` if it\u0027s explicitly terminated and there are no outstanding threads as `terminate(Api)` will have taken care of everything. We only need `terminate(NoActiveThreads)` when `terminate(Api)` couldn\u0027t have done a full cleanup due to outstanding threads, in which case doing what you did is going to take care of it. Thanks for bearing with me :) and all the adjustments!",
