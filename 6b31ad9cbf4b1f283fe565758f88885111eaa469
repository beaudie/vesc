Take this test for example:\n\n- Attach FBO to texture level 0\n- Draw\n- glTexSubImage2D into texture level 0\n- Draw again\n\nWithout this change, the data upload would be lost because it\u0027s written to a command buffer that\u0027s already flushed. Isn\u0027t that correct?",

So effectively after the render pass is closed, the command buffer gets reallocated to the same one!\n\nProbably the (or one of) the reasons Tobin couldn\u0027t increase that number is the very same bug you are fixing here.\n\n---\n\nMy suggestion would be to:\n\n- Fix this minimally (get the command buffer here) and submit it.\n\nAs a follow up:\n\n- Increase kNumCommandBuffers to at least 4\n- In functions that record a command in the command buffer, add an ASSERT that the command buffer is initialized/active/whatever (effectively a bool that on flush gets set to false and back to true when the command buffer is selected again)\n- Fix any other similar bugs that are encountered",
