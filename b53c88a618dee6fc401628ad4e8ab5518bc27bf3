      "message": "I believe a previous optimization of yours somewhere else did the same thing (convert atomic_bool to atomic_int). I believe the difference came down to C++ requiring bool to have a value of 0 or 1. So after loading from the atomic, it was adding an instruction to turn every non-0 value to 1. With atomic_int, you don\u0027t have the extra instruction.",

      "message": "This commit removes `WaitableEventDone`, so this is impossible.\n\nIn the follow up CL, `waitable` will be passed into the `task` in order to possibly use it as a dependency for child tasks. The `waitable` can\u0027t be *ready* when passed to the `task`, since it is still running.\n\nIn the current commit, replacing `WaitableEventDone` with `AsyncWaitableEvent` is essentially a no-op change, that is easy to review. I made separate change to reduce code diff in the follow up CL.\n\nOptimization of `WaitableEventDone` is a side effect of this change.\n\n---\n\nAlternative to removing `WaitableEventDone` is to pass `nullptr` as `event` into the `task`, and also to always wait all dependencies when running task in the `SingleThreadedWorkerPool`. These are the limitation that I mentioned in the commit message. These limitation may cause bugs:\n- need to check `event` for `nullptr`.\n- can\u0027t post task into `SingleThreadedWorkerPool` from `AsyncWorkerPool` task, while using async task `event` as dependency - **deadlock**.\n\nUsing `AsyncWaitableEvent` in the `SingleThreadedWorkerPool` does not have these limitations.",

Otherwise, you will likely have a deadlock bug.\n\nIn this particular case we will have a bug if remove mutex lock from `markAsReady()`.\n- thread 1: checks `isReady()` false in `wait()`.\n- thread 1: checks `mIsReady.load(std::memory_order_relaxed) \u003d\u003d 0` and **decides** to start waiting on the `mCondition`.\n- thread 2: calls `mIsReady.store(1, std::memory_order_release)` in `markAsReady()` (because **no mutex is locked**).\n- thread 2: calls `mCondition.notify_all()`, but since \"thread 1\" is not waiting yet - call will be **no-op**.\n- thread 1: **starts waiting** while `mIsReady` is `1`.\n- thread 1: will may **infinitely** (if no spurious waken), since `markAsReady()` was already called and it is called only once.",
