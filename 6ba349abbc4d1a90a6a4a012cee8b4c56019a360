      "message": "There was a bug here because samplerVk may be nullptr. Updated to just duplicate the texture serial if samplerVk is null. Does that seem reasonable? A couple alternatives would be to pass in an empty Serial or have some default fallback serial that\u0027s initialized at context creation and always used.",

      "message": "The texture and sampler cannot possibly have the same serial, right? In that case, this sounds correct.\n\nAlternatively, you can use 0 for the sampler serial, indicating \"no sampler\". That requires serials to start from 1.\n\nJamie should be able to tell if either of these approaches is wrong.",
