      "message": "So RGBA for RGBX won\u0027t really work. ANGLE (Vulkan) goes to great lengths to make sure the A channel always return 1.0, and is never clobbered. Replacing it with RGBA can cause havoc, including making the DRM image look transparent, or with blending etc.\n\nWe added ANGLE_rgbx_internal_format.txt to make GL_RGBX8_ANGLE an official format. I think it\u0027s only supported by the Vulkan backend, was the problem GL? We can also add another extension for GL_BGRX8_ANGLEX if necessary.\n\nFYI, we used RGB8 before because on Vulkan it implicitly always became RGBX8 under the hood (but that\u0027s no longer true on ARM).",
