      "message": "That was what I originally intended, but I recall there\u0027s a warning about passing `this` into an object in the constructor initializers. I can\u0027t find the warning now, but it\u0027s something about `this` not being completely constructed, so it\u0027s dangerous to give its pointer. This is a work around that warning.\n\nCould also be that the warning is not enabled, so it won\u0027t be an issue. Let me give it a try and see if there are compile errors on the bots (cl.exe build in particular).",
