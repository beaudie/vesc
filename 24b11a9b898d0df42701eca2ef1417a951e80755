      "message": "There are multiple ways to solve this.  I do want the solution to allow all the helper functions (maybeCaptureClientData, maybeCapturePostCallUpdates, etc) to work seamlessly with whatever the new call is.\n\nI had a different approach at first that would allow using multiple new calls to replace one call, but it wasn\u0027t required for this situation.  I can bring that back, uplevel the replacement logic to to CaptureCallToFrameCapture() and issue calls to captureCall() with the new call(s).\n\nIs that closer to what you\u0027re thinking?",
