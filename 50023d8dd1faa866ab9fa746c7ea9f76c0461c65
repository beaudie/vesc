Unfortunately, AGI is not working for me at the moment, so I can\u0027t really tell how much this affected the counters. I\u0027ll follow up another time with an optimization to the vertex attributes which follows from the same spec language.\n\nThat said, it\u0027s a change in an obviously good direction, even if it doesn\u0027t show at the moment.",
