      "message": "So in this CL you chosed always track R/W for all resources. My recommendation is still go with inheritance. The reason is simply that what you try to solve is a limited case, but why have all usage cases take extra CPU cost to have to update two mUse. retain/release are called on every resource used at each renderpass (when we do submission for each RP).",

Charlie what\u0027s a use case where you would be able to see the impact of the overhead? Maybe a simple draw with one state change? Or using a lot of textures?",

If there\u0027s a cost to optimization in terms of increasing code complexity it\u0027s worth knowing the the benefit in terms of runtime - just my two cents.\n\nDesign-wise I\u0027d be fine with not using inheritance, and just implementing two classes, vk::Resource and vk::ReadWriteResource. The code savings from the inheritance is pretty small, and generally inheritance is not a good fit a lot of the time.",
