I would even suggest just copy pasting from OutputGLSLBase.cpp and adapting it to wgsl where there is a difference",

      "message": "Actually most of this is copied and adapted from the MSL translator. Looking at OutputGLSLBase.cpp, it looks extremely similar to the MSL translator.\n\nAnyway it looks like the third_party/angle/src/compiler/translator/HashNames.h util might be useful, but I think I might need to hash mangled names since WGSL doesn\u0027t support overloaded functions. Does this work for now?",

The end2end tests (in GLSLTest.cpp) are best IMO and they simultaneously test every backend too.\n\nIf you want a convenient showcase of what\u0027s getting output, maybe keep this one only and every CL change it as needed. When the basics of the translation are done, you might as well delete this file and focus on the end2end tests.",
