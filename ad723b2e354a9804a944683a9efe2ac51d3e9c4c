I would even suggest just copy pasting from OutputGLSLBase.cpp and adapting it to wgsl where there is a difference",

      "message": "Actually most of this is copied and adapted from the MSL translator. Looking at OutputGLSLBase.cpp, it looks extremely similar to the MSL translator.\n\nAnyway it looks like the third_party/angle/src/compiler/translator/HashNames.h util might be useful, but I think I might need to hash mangled names since WGSL doesn\u0027t support overloaded functions. Does this work for now?",
