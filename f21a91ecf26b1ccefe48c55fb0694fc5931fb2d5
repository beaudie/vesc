      "message": "Thanks for the fix! If there isn\u0027t one already, do you mind adding a test that tests state changes here? Like draw with GL_SAMPLE_COVERAGE enabled, then disabled, then enabled again.\n\nSpecifically w.r.t this change, the test should do something like draw single sampled, change the framebuffer attachment to be multisampled, draw, change attachment back to single-sampled, draw. If you want to go the extra mile, you can have a variant that changes the framebuffer binding instead of changing the framebuffer itself.",

      "message": "It refers to `TextureCaps.sampleCounts`. If that set contains `1`, then it\u0027s possible to create a \"multisample\" renderbuffer with only one sample, which should follow multisampling rules wrt coverage.\n\nCurrently, only Direct3D backends do that. Others would clamp such requests to `2` or `4`. Should Vulkan backend follow this behavior, this condition would have to be adjusted.",
