      "message": "Hi Igor, thank you so much for your work!\n\nAs Shabi mentioned, we have removed the dependency of program binary cache key to the ANGLE git hash, the change is in this CL: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/4144078.\n\n`commit_id.py` script is still executed during build, however, we are not using its\u0027 results in shader program [serialize](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/angle/src/libANGLE/Program.cpp;l\u003d3493) and [deserialize](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/angle/src/libANGLE/Program.cpp;l\u003d3595) any more.\n\nYour change is great, but it might not be used by ANGLE shader program cache, due to lack of access to git on Android build infrastructure.",
