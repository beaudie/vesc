      "message": "This is the core of the fix. All the other code is really get to this point so that when we\u0027re linking we can know two things:\n1. Are we dealing with an input invariant due to \"#pragma STDGL invariant(all)\"?\n2. Are we in webGL compatibility mode?\n\nIf 2 is true we always create a link error as webGL behavior deviates from ESSL100 spec in this case. Otherwise if the input invariant is due to a pragma, let the link occur despite a mismatch which allows the 1 pathological dEQP GLES2 test to pass.",
