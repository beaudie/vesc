By the time of line 2666, `label` should be invalidated.\n\nThis might not be triggering ASAN because it\u0027s in the same stack frame and there\u0027s no other stack usage, but this seems unsafe, and perhaps worthy of a code audit? This particurlaly comes in to play later (line 2677)\n\nI could be reading things totally wrong though, but I\u0027ve just learned to be wary of references-from-const-char*",
