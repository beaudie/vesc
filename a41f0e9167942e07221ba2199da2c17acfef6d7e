      "message": "i wanted to call your attention to a particular piece of code we are blocked on, this\nif-condition is where we check that there are no valid framebuffer attachments and hence\ndoesn\u0027t make sense to create a renderpass. but we had issues -\n1) if we did an early return here with a \"continue\" without creating the renderpass we\n   crash in the caller due to an assert\n2) we changed it to create an empty renderpass just so we wouldn\u0027t assert and it caused\n   validation errors and other issues\n\nis there a way to \"early-return\" from this function in a valid way? or are we doing this logic at the wrong abstraction level?",
