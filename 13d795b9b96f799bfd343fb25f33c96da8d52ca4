The instructionâ€™s operands may also be truncated to the relaxed precision.\n\nI\u0027m not finding anything that calls out \n\nIs there a reason just FindSMsb is special here, or should all Find*Msb instructions drop RelaxedPrecision (or even all instructions here)?",

      "message": "Done regarding comment.\n\nRegarding FindSMsb, yes, FindUMsb is the same. The op is checking the GL findMsb (which could translate to either of those SPIR-V instructions), so the code was correct. Updated the comment not to single out the S variant.\n\nWhy only findMSB? Because it\u0027s the only operator I\u0027ve found that needs its operand to be highp but its return value is lowp. If we find others ever, they should be added here too.",
