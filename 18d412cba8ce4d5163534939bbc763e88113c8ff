      "message": "Huh, this must have been a bug. It should have called `getLevelExtents(sourceLevelGL - mImage-\u003egetBaseLevel())`. Could you please file a bug for this and assign it to me? I\u0027d like to write a regression test for it, because it looks like flipped copies from non-zero-levels is broken right now.\n\nWhen you pass srcDimensions from the caller, you can either keep this bug as is, or use the (I believe) correct call I mentioned in the last paragraph.",
