      "message": "Huh, this must have been a bug. It should have called `getLevelExtents(sourceLevelGL - mImage-\u003egetBaseLevel())`. Could you please file a bug for this and assign it to me? I\u0027d like to write a regression test for it, because it looks like flipped copies from non-zero-levels is broken right now.\n\nWhen you pass srcDimensions from the caller, you can either keep this bug as is, or use the (I believe) correct call I mentioned in the last paragraph.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t follow.\n\nI used a variable so that I could swap width and height for 90 \u0026 270 (above).  I think your concern is that I\u0027m getting it from the framebuffer (your previous comment).  However, your previous comment suggests I pass this variable from the calling function.  Should I call this from the calling function, or the new one you suggest, or can I call one of them in this function (before my rotation code)?",
