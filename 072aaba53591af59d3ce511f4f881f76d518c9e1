      "message": "This is something we should do in VertexArrayGL so it\u0027s cached and doesn\u0027t need to be set and reset every draw call.\n\nI would pass the baseInstance parameter to setDrawArraysState/setDrawElementsState and feed it into VertexArrayGL::syncDrawState.  VertexArrayGL can have a new mAppliedBaseInstance that it compares the new basevertex with and updates the attributes if needed.\n\nThere are a couple things missing in this code that need to be handled though: glVertexAttribIPointer needs to be called for integer attributes, glVertexAttribPointer can\u0027t be called in all cases (see VertexArrayGL::callVertexAttribPointer).  Also, when glVertexAttrib[I]Pointer is called, it captures the current GL_ARRAY_BUFFER to use as the attribute source, so you have to bind the buffer first.  I\u0027m guessing the tests only use one buffer and it\u0027s bound at this time.",
