If the user queries for the size of a message and then queries the message itself but a message is inserted between those times, it could cause issues.\n\nI think we want an invariant that messages cannot be inserted by other threads and remove the lock from Debug. I suspect this is already the case. Context loss is the only case I know of of errors being injected into other contexts.",
