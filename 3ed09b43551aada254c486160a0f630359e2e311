I was debugging something else and wanted to try angle::Result::Continue.\n\nI checked the spec yesterday, and it can be done, but should return an INVALID_OPERATION error (which the validation code does generate).  Here\u0027s some of the language:\n\n  This will install executable code as part of the current rendering state for each\n  shader stage present when the program was last linked successfully.\n\n  An INVALID_OPERATION error is generated if program has not been\n  linked successfully. The current rendering state is not modiÔ¨Åed.\n\nI did try angle::Result::Continue and it also worked.  I\u0027ll go with that.",
