If it doesn\u0027t, that\u0027s a serious problem we should check regardless of this change.\n\nANGLE officially supports Vulkan 1.1, I was about to add a change to make ANGLE refuse to work on a Vulkan 1.0 instance/device.\n\nFWIW, since CuttleFish is running over swiftshader, the problem may just be in the loader (i.e. the instance version)?",
