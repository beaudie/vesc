      "message": "I\u0027m missing why you are deleting this code.  This code is run before any VkSurface\u0027s are created, and allows the EGL configs to be created that take into account all of the formats that the Vulkan loader supports.  It should also provide all of the colorspaces that are supported by the Vulkan loader.  IIRC both come from the Gralloc/driver code below the Vulkan loader.",

      "message": "all of this has been streamlined and moved to DisplayVk since there is nothing android specific, it is just conditional on a couple of vulkan extensions being supported.\n\nFor the specific question about config format check, you can take a look at `DisplayVk::initialize` it has been updated to call `initSupportedSurfaceFormatColorspaces` which happens once and then we cache the results. no need to repeatedly keep calling `vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormats2KHR`",
