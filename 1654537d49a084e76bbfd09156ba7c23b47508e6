      "message": "Just fyi, \"emulatedInstanceID\" is not really needed. This \"emulation\" was supposed to support instance drawing feature on non-capable hardwares. It originated from my old code. However, it was removed because instance draw is in fact always supported on all Apple\u0027s Metal capable hardwares,\n\nI suggest you take note on this because this emulation code has been removed and re-added back and forth multiple times in the past months since direct-to-metal patch was introduced due to misunderstanding and mis-coordinating between multiple parties.\n\nKeeping this emulation code path would make it easier to be in sync with Webkit. However, it will just be dead code that will be never be used and add unnecessary maintenance\u0027s efforts.",
