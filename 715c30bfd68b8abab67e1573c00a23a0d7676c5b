      "message": "Actually I see it needs to be Incomplete for the way it\u0027s written in linkImpl. Really we should remove ::Incomplete and add some kind of more specific out parameter if there\u0027s a loading error. As it is written in this CL glProgramBinary will silently succeed if there\u0027s a load error of this kind. Since that\u0027s how it worked before this CL, seems okay to keep it that way.",
