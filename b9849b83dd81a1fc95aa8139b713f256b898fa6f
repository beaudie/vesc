      "message": "The issue really only applies to WGL (so windows), but at the time I thought it might be resolved quickly and removing the tests from Vulkan altogether would be ok.\n\nIt\u0027s certainly no biggy, but perhaps ES31_VULKAN() could be added, conditioned to `#ifndef _WIN32` so we don\u0027t lose coverage.",
