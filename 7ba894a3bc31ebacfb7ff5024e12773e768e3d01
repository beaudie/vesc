      "message": "Thanks!\nIn this update, the following main updates have occurred:\n* The lower-level functions, which are related to allocation, return `VkResult` instead of `angle::Result` (with the exception of `initializeNonZeroMemory()`).\n* The main macros from the last update have been replaced with `ContextVk` functions.\n* In addition, in order to reduce the CL\u0027s diff, some of the result bubbling, especially in `vk_helpers`, have been limited.",
