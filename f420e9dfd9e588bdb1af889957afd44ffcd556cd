      "message": "It\u0027s not very clear to me what the rules really are. For example, what happens in this situation?\n\n    highp float x \u003d 10.0;\n    float y \u003d x;\n\nShould y be highp or the default (let\u0027s assume the default is mediump)? You also have:\n\n    lowp float z \u003d x;\n\nWhich means just looking at EOpInitialize shouldn\u0027t be enough to tell if promotion should happen or not. You probably need to have a way to know if the variable\u0027s precision was specifically specified or if it\u0027s left to default, then promote or not based on that.\n\nThe now-deleted setPrecision(higherPrecision) call used to promote the precision in case of EOpInitialize, but that doesn\u0027t happen now.\n\n---\n\nI\u0027m also not sure if assignment should follow the same rules. Like, what\u0027s the precision of y here?\n\n    highp float x \u003d 10.0;\n    float y \u003d 1;\n    y +\u003d x;\n\nShould y get promoted to highp or remain default?",
