      "message": "Hi Geoff! Can you please take a look? It turned out that DisplayEGL is almost sufficient for our surfaceless Wayland implementation. The only required changes are 1) correct display attributes (basically the ones that DisplayGBM uses, which look the same as we pass from Chromium as well)..And it also required to use a single renderer for different contexts (if I understand correctly, it\u0027s because sufaceless uses virtual context? I got this impression from DisplayAndroid that also supports surfaceless impl).\n\nAt least, this makes Ozone/Wayland + surfaceless path work with ANGLE, webgl demos work and also webgl conform tests still pass.",
