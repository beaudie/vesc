      "message": "shabi - PS8 is ideal in that the shader state struct is moved to `common/`, both the header and the implementation but causes errors\n\nPS9 is where the header is in `common/` but the implementation is in `compiler/` which kinda makes sense and sorta mirrors how ShaderVars header and implementation is in different locations. i am fine with this workaround or am open to ideas you have on how to fix PS8",

I put CompiledShaderState into its own lib (`angle_common_shader_state`), so `angle_common` stays what it is (and used by many targets), and `angle_common_shader_state` can be used by whoever needs it (currently only libANGLE. I presume later you\u0027d want to add this as a dependency of `angle_shader_translator`",
