      "message": "shabi - PS8 is ideal in that the shader state struct is moved to `common/`, both the header and the implementation but causes errors\n\nPS9 is where the header is in `common/` but the implementation is in `compiler/` which kinda makes sense and sorta mirrors how ShaderVars header and implementation is in different locations. i am fine with this workaround or am open to ideas you have on how to fix PS8",
