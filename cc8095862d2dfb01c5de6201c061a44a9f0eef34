Now you are doing lock/unlock directly on mMutex and std::unique_lock has its own tracking of if it owns the lock or not, and this makes unique_lock\u0027s tracking inaccurate.\n\nWe want the code between unlock and relock to be minimum, explicit lock/unlock is not a bad idea though. I am not fan of this CL.",
