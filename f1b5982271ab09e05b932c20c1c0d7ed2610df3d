      "message": "thinking about this more, one suggestion I have before landing is to update the libpng GN -\n\ncan we change DEPS to sync linbpng to third_party/libpng/src, and place this BUILD.gn in third_party/libpng, along with a README.angle? Assuming we\u0027re only using this in standalone, I think this would be a better approach than using secondary, which seems like a specific hack to work with projects which aren\u0027t synced to a src/ subfolder.",
