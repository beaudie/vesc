      "message": "Hey Jun! Please give this change a shot. Compiler tests are disabled if ESSL/GLSL is disabled. If you want to continue testing these unittests, please add `angle_enable_essl\u003dtrue` and `angle_enable_glsl\u003dtrue` to your args.gn. You could use these args without this change too, as a workaround to the build failure until this lands.",
