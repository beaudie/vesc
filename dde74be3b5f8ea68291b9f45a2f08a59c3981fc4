      "message": "Most of the diffs look perfectly fine. Except the water reflection in asphalt_8 which has visibly lower quality. I\u0027d check with native to see how the reflection looks like there. I\u0027ll leave it to @Cody to tell if that\u0027s acceptable (it _is_ in my opinion, because we are respective the user\u0027s choice of mediump more strongly now)\n\nThat said, I\u0027d take the traces with the biggest diffs (car_chase, black_desert_mobile, manhattan_31, portal_knights and aztec_ruins_high) and do a before/after comparison of performance. Is this change improving or degrading the performance in any measurable way?",
