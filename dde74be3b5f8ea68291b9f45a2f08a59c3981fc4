As mentioned last time, the change will result some render results difference: https://angle-gold.skia.org/search?issue\u003d4400404\u0026crs\u003dgerrit\u0026patchsets\u003d8\u0026corpus\u003dangle.\n\nHow to determine if such difference is acceptable?",

      "message": "Most of the diffs look perfectly fine. Except the water reflection in asphalt_8 which has visibly lower quality. I\u0027d check with native to see how the reflection looks like there. I\u0027ll leave it to @Cody to tell if that\u0027s acceptable (it _is_ in my opinion, because we are respective the user\u0027s choice of mediump more strongly now)\n\nThat said, I\u0027d take the traces with the biggest diffs (car_chase, black_desert_mobile, manhattan_31, portal_knights and aztec_ruins_high) and do a before/after comparison of performance. Is this change improving or degrading the performance in any measurable way?",

      "message": "Thank you Shabi and Cody for checking the rendering diffs.\n\nThe trace results before and after this change is here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PNnb83pAgFgbsyo4VskDZqhHNhduq7cugVEfi13IWUU/edit?usp\u003dsharing. On Pixel 7, after the change, most of the traces `wall time compare` improved. On Pixel 6, more than half of the traces `wall time compare` degraded. The change of `wall time compare` and `CPU time compare` is consistent: if `CPU time` improved after change, the `wall time` improved, too. Since the GPU measurement on ARM is broken right now, I can\u0027t get the GPU perf data with the current trace test. Any recommendations on how to get GPU perf impact? Charlie has recommended \nme `writing a specific test that runs shader on a large FBO and benchmark the rendering operation`. Would you please let me know if this is necessary?\n\nI have compared the native and angle results of the 16 traces that failed the test: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ot9UAPBPGMfKAXkQZx24WujStAZdDOYeZKWW57QuwFg/edit?usp\u003dsharing. Most of the diffs match with the diffs that is flagged by the golden trace tests. The `asphalt_8` water rendering on native is closer to the reference image in Gold test, unfortunately. If this is a concern, how should we proceed here? Shall I debug it in RenderDoc and understand why the change is making the rendering more pixelated?",
