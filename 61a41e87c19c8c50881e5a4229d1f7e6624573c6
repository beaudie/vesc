Also, it\u0027s not clear to me whether a driver upgrade on the Linux/Intel bot would address the failure there. I recall an email conversation but it\u0027s not reflected on the associated bug.\n",

I\u0027ve just been trying to understand the bug first.\n\n\u003e\u003e Also, it\u0027s not clear to me whether a driver upgrade on the Linux/Intel bot would address the failure there.\n\nBased on the behavior on https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/3645786/6..7/src/tests/gl_tests/PixelLocalStorageTest.cpp, and the fact that it fixes the same bug on various OSes and backends, I\u0027m quite convinced that there is a bug related to binding an image for just reading. I\u0027m investigating locally now.",
