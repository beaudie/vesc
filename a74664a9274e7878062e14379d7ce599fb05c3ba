      "message": "Hey Cody, so I figured we can easily avoid getting traces nuked from the device by end2end tests in local tests with something like this. Could you give it a try? How much more do you think we would need to add to make this usable instead of running ./angle_end2end_tests? One thing I can think of right away is batching when there is lots of tests to run - catapult runs tests in batches of 256. Otherwise, most other flags are actually for the test binary on the apk and I\u0027m just passing them through here. RunTests supports --render-test-output-dir and --isolated-script-test-output (temp paths on device, then pull) though I didn\u0027t test this for the end2end case.",
