      "message": "reviewers: I don\u0027t recommend looking too closely at the new results script, as it\u0027s mostly already-reviewed code. I chose to clone it because modifying the original to add build info to histograms for ANGLE would have been moderately invasive, and this gives us a route where we can maintain this script going forward. If you feel that we need to review it more carefully, I can commit the original Chromium script then amend this script to just show the diff with my changes.",
