      "message": "We could maybe add a second alternative extension field to TSymbol, make it an std::array with length 2 for example since there\u0027s already a function for checking an std::array of extensions. I could also look into a different way to handle ARB_texture_rectangle by defaulting the extension directive state to enabled in case the extension is supported. I\u0027d prefer to do those changes as a separate patch, what do you think?",
