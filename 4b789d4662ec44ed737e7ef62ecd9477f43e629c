      "message": "I think your alignment should at least match this size so that guard blocks don\u0027t span cache lines.   Ideally the alignment should land at the start of a cache line (64B aligned?) so the CPU can do the full check in a single cache line and have some of the real data available immediately while prefetching the next line.\n\nChecking these will already slow things down, but that may help it a little.",
