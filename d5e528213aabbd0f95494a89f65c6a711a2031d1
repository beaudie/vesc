Is there any way to test this on a bunch of different hardware without any ANGLE bots? Or should the removed-device-specific handling take care of the issues that were seen way back when?",

Chrome should theoretically kill the re-creates the GPU process anew, according to John, so it may not be a big concern.\n\nWe could consider the patches above to be a \"best-effort\" approach, although there may be driver flakiness in some cases.
