      "message": "In theory you could get here. With per share group garbage list, there is no async thread doing clean up. If you have many many contexts, you could end up here. Or if smaller number of contexts but each context generates many commands really fast, you could also eventually exhaust the events in some extreme case. So add a safety net here to do the last effort to wait and clean up might get events creation success still provides value. But with normal usage, you are not expected to hit this, thus a WARN() message above to help easy debugging.",

Making cleanup call at least we tried some effort here. Again, this is only for extreme cases that no real app could ever hit.",
