      "message": "This CL will be combined into: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/2450449\n\nThis CL contains a \"fix\" (really a work-around) for test failures caused by the combination of:\n\n1) A global-variable that points to a DebugAnnotator\n\n2) end2end tests that don\u0027t cause that global pointer to change when the tests change which back-end is used.\n\nThe basic approach is that whenever a new test starts using a different back-end, it switches to a different context; and so the MakeCurrent for a given back-end will install the appropriate DebugAnnotator as the global DebugAnnotator.  This is only done for the back-ends that will have such contention (D3D9, D3D11, GL, Vulkan).",
