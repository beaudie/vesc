      "message": "One special thing about `hasActiveRenderPassWithCommands` was that if the render pass is active but _without_ commands (i.e. RP started just to set loadOps to clear), then the reclear would just overwrite the old clear values. With this change, the reclears turn into `vkCmdClearAttachment`.\n\nThis can actually happen with 3D or external textures (see the block starting at line 612), leading to `clearWithLoadOp` (line 620).\n\nIs it possible to add the `\u0026\u0026 has commands` bit back to this expression?",
