I\u0027m not 100% sure the carve-out I added to redefineImage is fully correct, and the unilateral disabling of staging buffers for textures on Intel was unfortunate - but both of these are needed to make Zoom perform acceptably on the Metal backend.\n\nAll: any suggestions are welcome, and if you have other ideas about how to address these hot paths better, please feel free to put up a different CL. Thanks.",
