      "message": "Gregg tried something recently I had never done, and that is to insert the functions before the queued replacements are processed: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/3134963/7/src/compiler/translator/tree_ops/ConvertUnsupportedConstructorsToFunctionCalls.cpp#312\n\nI always assumed that would cause trouble as it changes the index of nodes, but it\u0027s seemingly fine. I should likely do something like that in the few other places we do this.\n\nThis comment from Olli (right in this function) made me hesitant to do that here:\n\n    // TODO(oetuaho@nvidia.com): It might be nicer to add the helper definitions also in the middle\n    // of traversal. Now the tree ends up in an inconsistent state in the middle, since there are\n    // function call nodes with no corresponding definition nodes. This needs special handling in\n    // TIntermLValueTrackingTraverser, and creates intricacies that are not easily apparent from a\n    // superficial reading of the code.\n\nI\u0027ll make a note to come back and see if I can avoid this disable/reenable dance everywhere.",
