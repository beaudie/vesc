      "message": "Thanks for the info, that\u0027s good to know.\n\nThe only reason I think this is interesting for GLES is because GLES doesn\u0027t allow most image formats to be readwrite, so you need two aliases -- one readonly and one writeonly. Since UAVs CAN be readwrite, you could just use a single UAV.\n\nContext: I\u0027m interested in helping implement a pixel-local-storage extension, which in D3D11 would use UAVs, or, ideally, coherent ROVs:\n\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/angleproject/issues/detail?id\u003d7279\n\nMaybe the D3D solution would just need custom backend code without trying to go through ES 3.1 shader images.",
