      "message": "This, and the variant with NULL, or ES3_AND_ES31 are pretty rare. The ES2_AND_ES3 case makes sense because every now and then there\u0027s a behavior change between the two. I suggest removing these two macros and do something like:\n\nANGLE_INSTANTIATE_TEST_ES2_AND_ES3(RobustBufferAccessBehaviorTest);\nANGLE_INSTANTIATE_TEST_ES31(RobustBufferAccessBehaviorTest);\n\ninstead of:\n\nANGLE_INSTANTIATE_TEST_ES2_AND_ES3_AND_ES31(RobustBufferAccessBehaviorTest);\n\nMy reasoning is that there are very few tests that need to be tested both on ES3 and ES31 for example.",

      "message": "Yes, this was what I initially attempted to do. However, I found that anytime the same test name was using in more than one macro, it led to compilation errors due to redefinitions of tests down the GTEST instantiation tree.\n\nJamie and I have some comments on this from earlier in the review back in \"Nov 08 8:56 AM\".\n\nI\u0027ve ultimately gone the route of creating a couple of lesser-used macros in order to stick to only ever having one macro instantiate the variations of each test name.",
