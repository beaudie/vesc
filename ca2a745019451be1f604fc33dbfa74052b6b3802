      "message": "Shabi/Tim PTAL. You were working with Ian on ImageView improvements.\n\nA direction I\u0027d like to go in is to do away with all the permutations in ImageViewHelper and just store a cache which indexes based on the bits needed to uniquely identify the particular sub-view. I think minimally it\u0027s be something similar to this plus a few bits for sRGB (and maybe a separate cache with bits for swizzle). That\u0027s out-of-scope for this CL just wanted to mention it.",
