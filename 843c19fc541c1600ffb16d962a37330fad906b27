      "message": "This approach could be built upon to narrow the skips to include trace name.  I think allowing fuzzy results on a case by case basis is the safest way to go.  Would you be okay gating this even further?  I could do it as a follow up if you\u0027d like to be done with this CL for now.",

      "message": "My intuitive thinking is that it\u0027s not worth spending our time on, as it wouldn\u0027t provide much safety. We don\u0027t really need to maintain NV and Intel at all, let alone for small pixel differences. That being said I\u0027m happy if you are happy to unblock this CL.\n\nLonger term it would be nice to move to an expectations format like we do for the other tests.",
