As a refresher, here\u0027s the last try (which was reverted):\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/2321735\n\nThe translator changes (RewriteRowMajorMatrices.cpp) have been removed this time, since angletypes.h is not available in src/compiler/.   I\u0027m open to suggestions on what we can do there, while still supporting angle::HashMap as a layer of indirection to enable/disable Abseil (another change in this CL).   That work can be in a follow-on CL too, once we get over the first hurdle of enabling Abseil at all.",
