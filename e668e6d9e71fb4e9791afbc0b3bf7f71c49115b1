      "message": "Yes please, I believe T-Rex showed the largest boost (IIRC 6%) on P4.\n\nFWIW, what I gathered from the WG was that this optimization should be done by the driver when possible, and that early_fragment_tests is to force it _despite_ the usual rules disallowing it. On some hardware, it was mentioned that it\u0027s worse to specify this than to let the driver decide it.",
