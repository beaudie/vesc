      "message": "In all cases, app should not need to call glFlush to create/insert a fence. Driver also should not need to issue flush, but driver has to create a clear boundary in the command buffer so that commands before and after are executed in the order.\n\nIn single context case, app also do not need to issue a flush before wait for fence. Driver is expected to issue the flush before wait, if needed.\n\nIn multi-context case, app is required to issue a flush before second thread try to wait for the fence, because driver is unable to issue the flush for other context.\n\nThis usage case is multi-context usage case, so I think flush is required, because the wait is in a separate thread.",
