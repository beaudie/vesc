      "message": "Yes. Too much hassle with render pass objects, as you can see from all the paths that FF takes without dynamic rendering, and depth/stencil makes it even more complicated (for example, you _don\u0027t_ want to be permanently in D/S FF mode, that interacts terribly with read-only depth/stencil feedback loop). With DR, you don\u0027t need that perma-FF thing.",
