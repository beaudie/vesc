      "message": "Just use memory barriers, the texel buffer is likely large enough for this operation to dirty the entire cache (so a partial flush/invalidate is not going to really save anything). That\u0027s besides the fact that we don\u0027t care about perf in this path, and the cost of barrier is tiny anyway.",
