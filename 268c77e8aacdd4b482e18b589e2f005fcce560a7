      "message": "I think you might want to update the binding. It could actually be a security bug. I imagine you could make a test:\n\n * init a buffer with the secret data.\n * use this buffer as a uniform buffer in the GL back-end.\n * bind a new buffer of size \"3\".\n * now you can read from the secret buffer in the shader.",
