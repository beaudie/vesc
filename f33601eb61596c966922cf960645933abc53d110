      "message": "Thanks for putting this together.   It looks reasonable to me, but we\u0027ll want to land this in upstream ANGLE, rather than Android (hence the -1 so it doesn\u0027t accidentally land).\n\nIf you\u0027re able to upload a CL directly, that would be ideal.   ANGLE has a \"Contributing Code\" page here:\nhttps://github.com/google/angle/blob/master/doc/ContributingCode.md\n\nLet me know if you need any help getting set up.\n\nOtherwise, presumably there\u0027s a way for one of us to make/submit a CL with these changes but have you own it.   I\u0027m not a git/gerrit expert, so I\u0027ll need to ask around if we go this route.\n\nLastly, Geoff is out until Dec 21, but we should be able to land this before then.",
