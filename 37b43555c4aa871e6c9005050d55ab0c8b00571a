      "message": "@geofflang@chromium.org I need your help debugging something here. Prior to the fix in this CL, getResult() was not called. Now that it\u0027s being called, `mShaderExecutable` is frequently nullptr. See https://ci.chromium.org/ui/p/angle/builders/try/win-test/17354/overview\n\nThe relevant history of this code is this: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/4808191/23/src/libANGLE/renderer/d3d/ProgramD3D.cpp#b551\n\nThe `ShaderExecutableD3D` used to get extracted at the end of link, and if it was not `nullptr`, debug info was added. My understand was that if the shader is not nullptr, then the corresponding `ShaderExecutableD3D` is also not nullptr (hence the previous `if` only checking the shader).\n\nCould you please check to see why the shader can be valid here but the executable nullptr?",
