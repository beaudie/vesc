Possible solutions:\n\nA) I move the optimization removal code from SpirvTransformer to initProgram so that it is removed from lineRasterEmulation program as well as default program.\nB) I can invalidate lineRasterEmulation whenever the optimization changes since the chance that combination of both  should be rare.\n\nB) seems easier and good enough.
