      "message": "PTAL. This existed at one point, adding it back in for startup perf.\n\nThe binary size cost of this is about 500kb (200-300kb per metal version). I could optionally gzip the the metallibs to about 300kb and then pay the cost of decompression at startup. Also going to look into compiling the 2.1 shaders into a separate library and updating the code to use a different library for those blit shaders.",

      "message": "In the past we decided to not precompile default shaders because if someone modifies the angle_format.json, then the default shaders will need to be re-generated. The angle_format.json is important because we reuse the format\u0027s enum values in the blitting compute shaders.\n\nThis is also problematic because if the person modifying angle_format.json mainly works on linux/windows, he/she might not have a mac machine to re-generate the metal shader binaries. Is it acceptable at this point?",
