I added this change originally like this in a previous change (which is really testing global variable initialization, not uniforms), and testing it with my code realized default uniforms had a bug. I committed that temporarily with a uniform block, but this was the original form of the test.\n\nAgain, not a relevant part of the test anyway.",
