Have CC\u0027d you on the associated bug.\n\nNote: it is probably necessary to upgrade BlockLayoutEncoder::mCurrentOffset from size_t to uint64_t for correctness on 32-bit platforms. Let me know if you\u0027d like me to make that change in this CL. Also happy to do it separately either before or after this one.\n",
