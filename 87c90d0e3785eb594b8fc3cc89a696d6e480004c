      "message": "\u003e Charlie has modified CommandQueue a lot, and some of what\u0027s in the description of the change should already be addressed. I see others in the list that are interesting additions.\n\nYes. This description accounts for the new `CommandQueue`. Differences in details.\nWhile `CommandQueue` uses mutex to allow access from contexts and the *asyncCommandQueue*, the `CommandQueue2` allow parallel access **without mutex**. For example: *asyncCommandQueue* may perform long submit operation (vkQueuePresentKHR(), for example), this would block context threads from performing any new tasks. `CommandQueue2` was designed initially to allow parallel execution of any job in the *asyncCommandQueue*, while allowing new tasks in the context threads. So the mutex is only used for context threads.\n\nOther difference, is that `CommandQueue2` supports simultaneously waiting for submission and completion on a GPU in a single operation. Mutex is unlocked once to wait for submission (if not submitted) and then wait for completion. `CommandQueue` on the other hand, supports only waiting for completion, waiting for submission is a responsibility for the `CommandProcessor`.\n\n`CommandQueue2` has wait for submission support because it also has additional submitting thread. I did not want back then to make a new infrastructure classes and make significant changes in the `CommandProcessor`. Everything should be in a single place, so it is easier to transfer to the new versions of Angle.",
