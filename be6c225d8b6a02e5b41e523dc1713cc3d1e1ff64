      "message": "Ack, I don\u0027t think this has any real perf impact. Previously we could no-op empty submissions which happen in test execution. In practice this doesn\u0027t affect any benchmarks or applications that I know of. We can revisit and implement an optimization here if we detect empty submissions happening in applications and this affects perf. Just to be clear: I don\u0027t expect to find that any time soon.",
