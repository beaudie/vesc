      "message": "Isn\u0027t this going to have the same problem we had with vertex array binding? That is, if you bind a few samplers and a program that doesn\u0027t use all of them + draw, then bind a program that does use one of the samplers that was previously unused, then that sampler never gets bound? Because syncSamplersState doesn\u0027t get called when only the program has changed?",
