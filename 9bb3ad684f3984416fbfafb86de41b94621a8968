Take this scenario:\n\n- Create depth/stencil renderbuffer R and attach it to a framebuffer\n- Draw into framebuffer\n- Invalidate depth/stencil\n- Delete R\n- Cause render pass to break\n\nWhat happens when R is deleted? If the render pass is closed automatically before R is deleted, it\u0027s ok, but if it happens after, then mDepthStencilImage would be a dangling pointer.\n\nCould you write a test for it and verify (with printf?) that end RP is being done before the ImageHelper is deleted?",

This was the scenario that motivated you and/or Jamie (forget who) to move mContentDefined to ImageHelper (it\u0027s not supposed to go away before the render pass ends:-).

      "message": "Right, thanks for clearing this up. I was thinking that the ImageHelper is stored in the garbage queue while we wait for cleanup. Instead we store the contents of the ImageHelper in a garbage list and destroy the ImageHelper itself. So this approach won\u0027t work out of the box.\n\nThere are existing tricky bugs with storing mContentsDefined in RenderPassVk as well. If you use an ImageHelper as an EGL Image source, and then invalidate the target, writes to the source will not \"restore\" the contents. This is a bit tricky and unlikely to occur in practice. There may be other cases where we access the ImageHelper separately from the Framebuffer that don\u0027t \"restore\" contents on write.\n\nFor now maybe dump some of this into an open issue and defer any follow-up until we run into such a situation. I suggest we land the tests you wrote.",

      "message": "Regarding modifying the image outside framebuffer, we do have a (hopefully complete) notification system. DIRTY_BIT_*_BUFFER_CONTENTS is set in such a case, and FramebufferVk::syncState, through a call to RenderTargetVk::flushStagedUpdates, sets contents defined.\n\nBecause we track contents defined in the render target, unfortunately we also set contents defined with DIRTY_BIT_*_ATTACHMENT because we don\u0027t know if the image was modified while not attached to the framebuffer.\n\nWhat generates the notification that sets DIRTY_BIT_*_BUFFER_CONTENTS can probably be adapted to instead directly set contents defined in the image. That was at least my plan for moving contents defined to the image.\n\n---\n\nRegarding the image deletion bug, a potential solution is to sync the framebuffers that are attached to the texture/renderbuffer that\u0027s being deleted before the actual deletion.
