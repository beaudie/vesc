      "message": "This is duplicating the SPIR-V binary for PPOs, where we previously reused the Programs SPIR-V blob in ProgramExecutableVk::getGraphicsPipeline() via the getShaderProgram() call.   We should avoid introducing this memory regression.\n\nI think it would be better for ProgramVk to continue owning mOriginalShaderInfo, since the SPIR-V is necessarily tied to a particular Program, and then ProgramExecutableVk can be updated to hold a pointer to the ShaderInfo for each shader stage.   That would allow this line to just update a pointer, rather than doing a memcpy() and getGraphicsPipeline() can get pointers to a ShaderInfo per stage, rather than a ProgramVk via getShaderProgram() which needs a ProgramVk and PPOVk pointer.",

      "message": "Hey Tim,\n\nI studied the memory usage of this change on my local machine with a CL to measure peak and median memory in the perf tests: http://crrev.com/c/3191194\n\nMy results for C\u0026C rivals were:\n\n               |  before   |  after\n median memory | 984644 kb | 986656 kb\n peak memory   | 984660 kb | 986672 kb\n \nThe net difference was in the ballpark of 10kb (there was some variance between runs).\n\nMy plan is to get to a place where we no longer need to modify the SPIR-V after the LinkProgram call. That would mean we don\u0027t need to even store the SPIR-V and this discussion becomes obsolete. This change has some nice cleanup benefits in removing the back-pointers, making the Executable encapulated, and is likely necessary for supporting failed re-links. Could we eat this small regression on C\u0026C rivals for now?",
