      "message": "this library was made shared library because it must be preloaded before any system libraries in order for the file API functions to be overriden. I don’t think making it static lib could override the API functions from system libs anymore.\n\nI think the “library not loaded” error you are facing could be solved by running “./angle_unittest” inside “out/Debug” folder instead of using relative path “out/Debug/angle_unnitest”.\n\nActually, angle_unittest doesn’t need to be linked against this file hooking lib directly. The file hooking lib just needs to be built and be available in the same folder as angle_unittest. I used gn’s “deps” property to enforce this, but it has side effect of forcing angle_unittest to be linked against this lib as well. If Jamie knows any gn options that enforce the above condition without making angle_unittest explicitly linked against the file hooking lib, it would be better.",
