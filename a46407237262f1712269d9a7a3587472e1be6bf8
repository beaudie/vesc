      "message": "Actually, I wonder whether this should be moved somewhere else - i.e. in Program or ProgramGL.\nAccording to the spec (ES 4.4.1), it is a link time error not to have the local group size specified.\n\nIf so, then in Shader.cpp I should retrieve from the compiler what\u0027s the local size. Since the input variable does not get stored in the AST, we cannot retrieve it with ShGetAttributes. I would somehow have to retrieve it from TCompiler.\nThere\u0027s a static function GetCompilerFromHandle in ShaderLang.cpp which I can use, but I guess it would be a bad idea to expose it. Should I add a function, i.e. ShIsComputeInputDeclared() ? I guess that wouldn\u0027t be a good idea as well.\n\nEventually, I could save it into the AST and retrieve it with ShGetAttributes.\n\nWhat do you think? Is there a better way?",
