description:
    "The goal of ANGLE is to allow users of multiple operating systems to "
    "seamlessly run WebGL and other "
    "OpenGL ES content by translating OpenGL ES API calls to one of the "
    "hardware-supported APIs available "
    "for that platform. ANGLE currently provides translation from OpenGL ES 2.0 "
    "and 3.0 to desktop "
    "OpenGL, OpenGL ES, Direct3D 9, and Direct3D 11. Support for translation "
    "from OpenGL ES to Vulkan is "
    "underway, and future plans include compute shader support (ES 3.1) and "
    "MacOS support."
