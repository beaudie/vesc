      "message": "Done.\n\nThe spec states that \"the maximum allowable width or height of a cube map or cube map array texture image must be the same, and is determined by [`2^(k-level)`], where `k` is [`log2(MAX_CUBE_MAP_TEXTURE_SIZE)`]\". This is checked in the condition above.\n\nHowever, the condition with `max3DTextureSize` is brought from the API spec (from ES 3.2), where it says: \"`GL_INVALID_VALUE` is generated if `width`, `height`, or `depth` is less than 0 or greater than `GL_MAX_3D_TEXTURE_SIZE`.\"\n\nIn my opinion, it makes sense to add `level` to width and height here as well.",
