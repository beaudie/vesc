      "message": "Looking at the SPIR-V diff of the only non-trivial shader, I suspect the reason for the failures is that gl_FragCoord (and correspondingly flippedFragCoord) was highp before this change and is mediump now.\n\nI see that ANGLE declares this variable as mediump (in builtin_variables.json), and GLSL ES 100 requires it to be mediump.  However, GLSL ES 320 requires it to be highp. That\u0027s most likely the reason for the failure.\n\nI\u0027ll find a way to fix it.",
