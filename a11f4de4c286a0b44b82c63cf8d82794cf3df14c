      "message": "So, there were 3 separate problems in the bug this addresses:\n1. Some tests are flaky and need to be suppressed\n2. Some tests time out, probably should be added to long tests list\n3. Often a whole batch of 256 tests times out, probably related to the problems that we saw when switching between Metal and GL, attributed to caching, but probably needs to be investigated further\n\nI don\u0027t mind to add the retries to get the CQ faster, but someone needs to further look at the above problems.",
