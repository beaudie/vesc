      "message": "The commit description says it, but it\u0027s not clear why flushing the texture in this case is any worse than if the upload was in a single staged buffer. Is it a case where the application is doing alternating uploads to textures, and this restriction happens to match that pattern coincidentally?",

      "message": "In this test, only the functionality is tested. In the regressed trace after the single-level flushing CL, some textures are deleted and redefined during the trace with many `TexSubImage` calls (one for each row). This leads to the performance regression. If the `TexSubImage` calls are reduced, the performance improves.\n\nThis CL should have minimal effect on the texture flushes when the trace is being loaded.",
