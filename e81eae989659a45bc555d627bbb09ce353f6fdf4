      "message": "I\u0027ve been thinking about how to handle this case a bit. I think in the end, this is addressing a very specific edge case with the GL_RGBX8_ANGLE format, the only format which accepts a different component count in `format` from the internal format.\n\nInstead, could we add a special case in `InternalFormat::computePixelBytes` along the lines of `if (sizedInternalFormat \u003d\u003d GL_RGBX8_ANGLE) components \u003d 3`? We could additionally pass the `format` to `InternalFormat::computePixelBytes` and assert that it is `GL_RGB` when we do this special case.",
