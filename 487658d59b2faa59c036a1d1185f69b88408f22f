I don\u0027t *think* any of this could could be used for that specific purpose, but if exposing it on the GL backend, maybe PLSProgramCache could be reused for implementing EXT_pls2 over EXT_pls.",

      "message": "Opinions, not strong ones:\n\nChris, did your experiments outside ANGLE show that using native EXT_pls wasn\u0027t faster than using shader images / framebuffer fetch? If so I\u0027m in favor of removing this code path and continuing to simplify the ANGLE_pls spec.\n\nChanging the allowlist to a ban list would make the ANGLE_pls spec easier to understand. There\u0027s a risk that new GLES extensions would require updates to the ANGLE_pls spec, but I think we can assume GLES isn\u0027t evolving quickly any more.\n\nWith ANGLE_pls\u0027s EXT_pls backend removed, are all the earlier constraints still needed, like forbidding transform feedback from being enabled? The less state in the extension, the simpler the browser-side implementation will be. The underlying EXT_pls doesn\u0027t document restrictions on transform feedback.\n\nI\u0027m all in favor of exposing the real EXT_pls in the Vulkan backend and don\u0027t want to take steps backward from that goal, but am also keenly interested in getting ANGLE_pls over the finish line.",
