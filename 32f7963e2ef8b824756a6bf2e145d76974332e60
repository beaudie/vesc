      "message": "I can\u0027t reproduce the windows test failure CopyTextureTest.CopyOutsideMipmap/ES2_OpenGL locally. I tried running with the batch filter that bot used, too, and I couldn\u0027t see the same issue locally, either. I also checked that this test doesn\u0027t go through the function Texture::copyImage(), so I would think that this CL shouldn\u0027t affect the failed test. I disabled the test on Windows platform, instead of just windows7. Please let me know if this is not preferred. Thank you!",
