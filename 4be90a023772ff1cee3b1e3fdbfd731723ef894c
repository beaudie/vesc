      "message": "Quoth the spec:\n\n\"When reading pixels from a color buffer, the buffer selected for reading is termed the read buffer\".\n\nThe extension:\n\n\"If the \u003cformat\u003e is DEPTH_COMPONENT, then values are obtained from the depth buffer.\"\n\nSo we should keep the \"read buffer\" or \"read attachment\" as color only. And only when the format parameter is DEPTH_COMPONENT (or stencil, etc) do we read from the depth or stencil attachments.\n\nLooking at the FramebufferVk code I also didn\u0027t see where you needed to clarify the read vs depth attachment. Was it just for querying the FB size? You can probably get that via a switch like you do for getting the RT.",
