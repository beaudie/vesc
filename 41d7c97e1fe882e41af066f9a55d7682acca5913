WindowSurfaceVk::resizeSwapchainImages is the one that\u0027s creating fresh new semaphores for the circular buffer.\n\nIn other words, image.presentHistory[*].semaphore is always valid for every element. Note also that validity does not mean \"unused by the PE\", this check just asserts that the semaphore is allocated.",
