      "message": "This CL is NOT READY for a thorough review yet, but I have a question ...\n\nThere are 6 states (my original 3 x 2 for m*Enabled) that can enter endRP.  Patchset 3 uses both m*InvalidatedState and m*Enabled (where * is either Depth or Stencil).\n\nQUESTION: Would you rather I keep it as is OR use 6 states and eliminate m*Enabled?\n\nFYI ... A thorough state diagram allowed me to handle all states and transitions.  The Invalidated+Enabled state is key:\n\n- Any time entering Invalidated+Enabled, the number of draw commands must be recorded/saved\n\n- Any time leaving Invalidated+Enabled, the recorded \u0026 current number of draw commands must be compared to determine whether the attachment becomes NoLongerInvalidated.\n\nIn the morning, I\u0027ll address your answer(s), simplify the code (e.g. create 1/more helper(s)), and  thoroughly test this.",
