      "message": "Replied in slack but repeating it here:\n\nANGLE initializes a surface, you need to request it by passing EGL_ROBUST_RESOURCE_INITIALIZATION_ANGLE to surface creation (not just context creation). Unless metal is uninitializing our surfaces, they should be auto-cleared with this mechanism (SurfaceMtl::initializeContents be called)\n\nWindowSurfaceMtl::getSwapBehavior returns EGL_BUFFER_DESTROYED which will trigger a re-init after each swap\n\nThe other surface types return EGL_BUFFER_PRESERVED which will only init once\n\nIs it possible that we\u0027re not doing the surface init in Safari or Chrome in some case?",

      "message": "That is a good question and I don\u0027t know the answer. Checking FramebufferMtl::invalidateImpl it appears these are being treaded as separate problems. One, marking general attachments as discardable and separately, clearing Surfaces (which might happen to be an attachment). \n\nI feel like maybe this code should have a much bigger refactor from just FrameBufferMtl to FramebufferMtlBase and then FrameBufferMtl (which represents glFramebuffr) and BackbufferMtl (which represents when the framebuffer is a backbuffer). As it is there\u0027s a bunch of places where there\u0027s `if (mBackbufer)`\nto special case when the FramebufferMtl represents the backbuffer.\n\nI\u0027m not sure now is the time to refactor",
