      "message": "Replied in slack but repeating it here:\n\nANGLE initializes a surface, you need to request it by passing EGL_ROBUST_RESOURCE_INITIALIZATION_ANGLE to surface creation (not just context creation). Unless metal is uninitializing our surfaces, they should be auto-cleared with this mechanism (SurfaceMtl::initializeContents be called)\n\nWindowSurfaceMtl::getSwapBehavior returns EGL_BUFFER_DESTROYED which will trigger a re-init after each swap\n\nThe other surface types return EGL_BUFFER_PRESERVED which will only init once\n\nIs it possible that we\u0027re not doing the surface init in Safari or Chrome in some case?",

There were effectively reentrant calls to ensureCurrentDrawableObtained which was losing the \"new-ness\" of the new drawable and therefore its initialization per spec.",
