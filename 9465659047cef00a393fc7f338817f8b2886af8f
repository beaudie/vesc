I had two ideas:\n\n1) we replace Bind calls in the trace with a custom fixture call. the custom call would update the resource map if it detects the bind is a create.\n\n2) the capture harness detects when a bind is a create, and calls the fixture to update the resource map explictly.\n\nor 3) always update the resource map in a bind anyway, which is similar to 1)\n\nWould be good to hear your thoughts \u0026 Cody too.",
