      "message": "Do you still need this call here? My understanding is that previously you need this because you are patching the DS, which will need to de-reference the view pointer, which is troublesome if view gets released earlier. But with this latest patchset, there is no DS patch up, DS is using handle of the view which will not gets freed until mUse indicates it is GPU complete. So my understanding is that this BufferViewHelper related change is no longer needed?",
