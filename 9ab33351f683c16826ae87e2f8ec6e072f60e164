      "message": "Yes, because `glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)` clears every active draw buffer, which may or may not include your PLS planes, depending on whether they are implemented as framebuffer attachments. So the only way to get consistent behavior across every device is to direct the app to `glClearBuffer*` instead.\n\nAlso note that we still need to add validation so `glClearBuffer` can\u0027t wipe out your PLS planes.\n\nWe could technically allow `glClear(GL_STENCIL_BUFFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT)`, but I think it\u0027s cleaner to just direct the app to `glClearBuffer*` for depth/stencil as well.",

Could that be perhaps allowed in the future with the (forgive me if I\u0027m referencing the wrong project) DrDc project?\n\nOn testing, TBH I\u0027d take inspiration from our entry point generation scripts and have the negative test be autogenerated. Then you don\u0027t have to manually code that, it would cover all forbidden functions automatically, and will continue automatically to add whatever new functions may be introduced ðŸ˜Š",
