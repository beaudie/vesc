      "message": "Doing `new` on reset is probably not a good idea, the default constructor could still make allocations etc.\n\nI think we should just call the destructor here. Later on resize(), `new` should be called if necessary (and a lot of times it\u0027s not necessary)",

      "message": "Yes...\n\nI was thinking about that. However if only call destructor we will end up with some element destroyed and some valid. This is a problem. Because destructors will be called automatically for all elements - so double destruction.\n\nI this patch I wanted to keep changes to minimum. Need to rewrite entire class to explicit construction/destruction. This should not be hard. Should I do this?",
