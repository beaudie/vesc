      "message": "Yes...\n\nI was thinking about that. However if only call destructor we will end up with some element destroyed and some valid. This is a problem. Because destructors will be called automatically for all elements - so double destruction.\n\nI this patch I wanted to keep changes to minimum. Need to rewrite entire class to explicit construction/destruction. This should not be hard. Should I do this?",

If there is no evidence of this mattering anywhere, I\u0027d say just leave the class be.\n\nI once made code using `FastVector` and was getting UBs (crashing). That is how I found the bug.

Not sure if old `Serial` values will cause any harm tho.\n\n\u003e Otherwise, the current CL is probably a good compromise as-is.\n\nIt should work. Most places use trivial types.
