Are you saying an application could read back the garbage values somehow and that\u0027s a security issue? How is that different from an application allocating an image, never clear it and read the garbage value?\n\n_Also it might be the case that we have an unused stencil channel. See D24_UNORM_X8_UINT. Similar stuff applies for this format._\n\nD24_UNORM_X8_UINT has always been emulated with VK_FORMAT_D24_UNORM_S8_UINT, so all the tests have been applied to that all along, but I\u0027ll make a specific one since I removed possible testing of that format in a previous change.\n\n---\n\nAll that said, I\u0027m beginning to think maybe I should also add a test to make a sure a stencil-only format is never affected by depth testing (and vice versa). I think the front end should be taking care of that, but there may a bug when it comes to emulated formats.",

What\u0027s the problem?\n\nIt depends on the command. Each command has some defined behaviour that might be broken if the depth was 0.5 instead of 0.0. For draw calls, we\u0027re supposed to always pass the depth test if there\u0027s no depth buffer. I\u0027m not sure if we could create a failing test specific to 0.5. Blit and depth textures are two other cases but again it might be hard to come up with a counterexample.\n\nI guess both for safety and consistency reasons I was hoping we could keep unused channels as their initial value. This is how we handled it for color channels where the problems are a bit easier to surface. For instance you can blit from RGB to RGBA and get the wrong values in the A channel. It might be harder to come up with a counterexample for the depth case. If you don\u0027t mind it would feel safer to ensure the depth values are always consistent (0.0) as they with unused color channels (0.0/1.0 as required). That\u0027s the intent of the issue I filed anyway.",
