      "message": "OK so I investigated the build failures... libc++ hardening appears to affect ABI somehow (though I thought it wasn\u0027t supposed to).\n\nNonetheless, even if we don\u0027t solve this now, we\u0027re going to have to solve it in the future since there may be hardening changes that intentionally break ABI.\n\nThe problem is that the angle tree currently just reuses third_party/abseil-cpp from Chromium. Chromium builds with libc++ hardening, so the symbol names don\u0027t match exactly.\n\nI\u0027m not entirely sure what angle\u0027s strategy for importing things from Chromium is. It would /possibly/ be easier to just manually up-rev absl in angle and separately maintain .defs... but then someone would have to be on the hook for actually doing that periodically (and any other gardening that would entail).",
