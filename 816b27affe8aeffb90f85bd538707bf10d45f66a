      "message": "Finally get the test passing. There are a few issues with patchset 3:\n1) packDepthStencilAttachment has an assert that assumes this is a new attachment. We are updating an existing attachment, so it hit assertion. To fix that, I have added a new updateDepthStencilAttachment() function just update the access mode.\n2) Test was using DEPTH_STENCIL format that not available on ES2. I have changed to DEPTH format since it is enough to demonstrate the bug. There is also other bug in the test that get fixed.\n",
