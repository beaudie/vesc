      "message": "this is interesting, I think there\u0027s a bit of underspecification here. The enums defined in the header can change between GL version (eg there\u0027s no law to say that ES can\u0027t define up to GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT41 in a new point release) and there\u0027s upper limit to GL_MAX_COLOR_ATTACHMENTS that I saw (might have missed it?)\n\nIf that\u0027s the case then it\u0027s not 100% clear when it\u0027s correct to return INVALID_ENUM or INVALID_OPERATION. That\u0027s a pretty edge case, so this LGTM, but I\u0027m a bit curious so I\u0027ll ping Shannon and Pyry.",
