      "message": "We have the ANGLE_TRACE_EVENT_INSTANT0 define.  It doesn\u0027t give what I want to see in an AGI frame capture.  The INSTANT macro creates a tiny box that you have to zoom way in before you can see it.  The ANGLE_TRACE_EVENT0 macro creates a large, readable box that\u0027s at least as large as the acquireNextSwapchainImage box that\u0027s also generated by ANGLE_TRACE_EVENT0 (which is larger than the AcquireNextImageKHR box that\u0027s below it).  Makes it **very easy** to see why we called ANI.",
