      "message": "Hi Correntin. Sorry that I used method 2 to support ssbo as binary operand. I thought it would be more complicated in implemention if we adjust the AST tree. But it seems that I am wrong. There are already some utils that I can conveviently to use. Now I am switching it to method 1 and the code is almost ready. Just one question about ssbo as the argument of a function (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/angle/angle/+/1349071), do you think that patch is still needed? Or it needs to be done in AST pass as well?",
