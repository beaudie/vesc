I\u0027m not sure how often the D3D drivers do this but there is no guarantee that they don\u0027t.  \n\nSince we already use this style of applied object tracking with uintptr_t, I\u0027d prefer to keep it for now. I\u0027ll rethink this and add a new method of tracking across all our D3D code in the future.",
